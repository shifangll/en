Wound motors are suitable for application with heavy starting duties such as ball sag mills,crushers etc.Typically LRS in these situations are used to start only,and when motor has reached a certain speed,the rotor is short circuited and it acts like an squirrel cage motor.FUNdaMENTALS of Design MIT201342&ensp&#0183&enspand wheel.Assume the wheels and ground are both hard,so rolling resistance itself is negligible.T o push the cart,a force F on each axle is Mg 4 is required.The instant center of rotation is the contact point between the wheel and the ground which is distance D 2 from the center of the axle.The condition for
