## Clay Dewatering
4&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;A typical company,producing 3 million ton yr of phosphate product,mines about 400 acres of land,removing 13 million yd&#179; of overburden,and produces 9 million yd&#179; of matrix.For each ton of phosphate produced,approximately 1 ton of sand tailings and 1 ton of clays must be disposed of.Environmental Risks From Mine TailingsSulfuric acid is sometimes produced when water interacts with tailings,or it can be a by product of ore processing.As a result,highly acidic water leaks from the tailings and disrupts aquatic life downstream.Tailings from copper and uranium mining often produce measurable levels of radioactivity.

## Mining Methods • Environment Guide
At the Taharoa mining site,sand is extracted from a pond by a floating dredge and then,because the area has no natural harbour,pumped as a slurry to a bulk cargo ship moored three kilometres from the shore plant to be processed and then exported.3447 Between 200 and 300 tonnes of magnetic concentrate is produced per hour.How phosphate is mined and processed21&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;How phosphate is mined and processes Mining Sedimentary phosphate tends to be found in loose sediment,so it can be mined with dredge lines (or picks and shovels).In Florida,the phosphate is found mainly in one layer of clay and sand that’s about 20 feet thick,and 50 feet below the surface.

## Mineral Processing Wastes
Large amounts of waste rock are produced from surface mining operations,such as open pit copper,phosphate,uranium,iron,and taconite mines.Small amounts are generated from underground mining.Waste rock generally consists of coarse,crushed,or blocky material covering a range of sizes,from very large boulders or blocks to fine sand size.INSIGHTS Phosphor Tailings Pond #2.Phosphate mining and the fertilizers that are produced from the element are environmentally problematic.Not only is the mining itself land intensive,disturbing thousands of acres annually,but the main by product known as phosphogypsum is highly dangerous and risks leaching toxic sludge during hurricane season into the groundwater.
