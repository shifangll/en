## Iron ore Wikipedia
The waste comes in two forms,non ore bedrock in the mine (overburden or interburden locally known as mullock),and unwanted minerals which are an intrinsic part of the ore rock itself (gangue).The mullock is mined and piled in waste dumps,and the gangue is separated during the beneficiation process and is removed&nbsp;.Export SectorsThe mining industry has potential to spearhead economic growth.The sector’s contribution to GDP is expected to grow by 1.6% in 2016,up from an estimated decline of 2.5% in 2015.Opportunities for growth exist within the entire mining value chain from exploration,extraction,beneficiation and other downstream industries.
