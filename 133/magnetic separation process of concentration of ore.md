## Magnetic Separation Method Mineral Processing & Metallurgy
Magnetic separation has two major applications in mineral processing plants: The removal of tramp iron (which would deleteriously affect subsequent processes) from an ore stream This is usually achieved by a low intensity magnet suspended above,or at the head of,a conveyor Separation of magnetic minerals from less magnetic mineralsEnrichment of Ore or Concentration of Ore Fun ScienceENRICHMENT OF ORE OR CONCENTRATION OF ORE.Before extracting the metal from an ore,it is necessary to remove the impurities present in it.By removing these impurities we get a concentrated ore which contains a high percentage of metal in it.The process of removal of gangue particles from an ore to increase the percentage of metal in ore is.
