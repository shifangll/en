## Wisconsin Geological &amp; Natural History Survey &#187; Hematite
Massive earthy hematite forms as a result of weathering of primary magnetite in iron formation exposed in the SW NE Sec.28 T.39N R.18E (Dutton,1971).— Hematite is common as soft massive material in the weathered Riverton iron formation where it replaces siderite and magnetite,and occurs with grunerite and stilpnomelane.67 questions with answers in HEMATITE Science topic&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;The major phases are Hematite,Iron Oxide Hydroxide,Silicon oxide,Pyrolusite and minor phases are Calcium carbonate,Calcium Iron Silicate,Dolomite.The photos indicate hematite magnetite.

## MAGNETITE (Iron Oxide)
Magnetite is an oxide of iron (as is hematite).It is not a component of ordinary rust,although it can form as iron oxidizes in a dry environment.When you see sparks from welding operations or from iron striking a hard surface (as when it is held against a spinning grinder),the sparks are due to the rapid (and exothermic) oxidation of tiny particles of iron into magnetite.Magnetite: Mineral information,data and localities.Jacobsite Magnetite Series.Magnesioferrite Magnetite Series.Magnetite is an important iron ore,along with hematite.Nanoinclusions of magnetite crystals cause the iridescence of Rainbow obsidian (Nadin,2007).Extremely thin layers of nm octahedral crystals of magnetite give some basalt surfaces an iridescent sheen (Nadin,2007).
