## Ore Grinding Mills
15&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Ore Grinding Mills are used for the fine grinding as the last step in the reduction of an ore prior to concentration (gravity or flotation) or cyanidation.Practice varies,depending upon the type of ore and the amount of reduction required.In addition,some of the older properties continue with methods that perhaps are not considered the best in light of recent improvements but that cannot be.Energy Use in US Steel Manufacturing6&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Iron ore is mixed with coke,a form of very pure coal.The blast furnace burns the coke to heat the iron ore causing it to react into iron (Fe 2),nitrogen (N 2),and carbon dioxide (CO 2).This iron is often known as &quot;pig iron&quot; or &quot;hot metal&quot; as it is a liquid iron that flows from the bottom of the blast furnace.
