The run of mine extracted from the ground requires further processing in order to make a marketable product.This preparation is called mineral processing.Thus,ores must go through a number of.Mining Thickener for Mineral Processing,Low Cost.Chilean Mill Mineral Processing Metallurgy.Although modern ore dressing practice employs Steel Head Ball Rod and Ball Mills in preference to the Chilean type mill for grinding purposes there is a field for these units where coarse grinding is required.

## Calculation of Mineral Liberation in a Continuously.
11&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;The calculation of the liberation spectrum in the product from a continuously operating ball mill is both important and difficult The liberation spectrum depends on the mineralogical texture of the ore from which the mill feed derives and also on the processing steps through which portions of the feed have passed prior to milling.These steps typically include classification by hydrocyclone or.comminution 图文 百度文库2011 6 19&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;The final particle size is determined by downstream processing requirements.Grinding is carried out as a wet process with water content between 50 70% by weight.Ball Mill ? Ball mills are a similar shape to that of the rod mills except that they are shorter with

## gold ore crushing and liberation
The primarily used equipment in crushing are jaw crushers,gyratory crushers and cone crushers whereas rod mills and ball mills,closed circuited with a classifier unit,are generally employed for grinding purposes in a mineral processing plant.Crushing is a dry process whereas grinding is generally performed wet and hence is more energy.
