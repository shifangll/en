14&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;The Crusher in the Tushar is one of those races that sounds like a great idea in February when registration opens after months of snow and little riding.It seems like a long time away with plenty of time to train.Riding up a forest road in the Tushar Mountains with the smell of the pines,little traffic and scenic lakes sounds idyllic.EventsCrusher in the Tushar is 70 miles.Sounds easy,right? Think again.Its 10.000 ft of accumulated climbing,finishing “sprint” up 12% grade at over 10.000 ft above sea level and weather ranging from sun and scorching 100&#176;F down in Piute Valley to wind and hail at Eagle Point makes Crusher one of the hardest gravel races out there.
