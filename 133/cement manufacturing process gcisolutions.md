## Cement
Portland cement,the most common type of cement in general use around the world as a basic ingredient of concrete,mortar,stucco,and non speciality grout,was developed in England in the mid 19th century,and usually originates from limestone.James Frost produced what he called &quot;British cement&quot; in a similar manner around the same time,but did not obtain a patent until 1822.How is Cement Manufactured and Processed?Cement manufacturing as a procedure and as a big production line has undergone many phases of makeover in current times.An integrated cement manufacturing process is that prepares the raw mix,feeds it to the pyro processing system (kiln),and then grinds the clinker from the kiln system into various cement products.

The production of cement products is also a heavy polluter as it is a high energy consuming process,being dependent on the burning of fuels to generate the necessary process conditions.Waste managementCement and pollution Cement kiln dust (CKD) is the fine grained,solid,highly alkaline waste removed from cement kiln exhaust gas by air pollution control devices.Because much of the CKD is actually unreacted raw materials,large amounts of it can and are,recycled back into the production process.
