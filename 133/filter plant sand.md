## Rapid Sand Filters
The Rapid Sand Filter (RSF) water treatment equipment differs from the Slow Sand Filter water treatment equipment in a variety of ways,the most important of which are the much greater filtration rate and the ability to clean automatically using back washing.The mechanism of particle removal also differs.Rapid sand Water filter does not use biological filtration and depends primarily on.Sand Carbon Multimedia Filtration SystemMultimedia Sand Filter Media Filtration is the most effective method for removal of suspended organic and inorganic solids from water.The media filters operate on the same basic principle as nature’s own ground water filtering process.Contaminated,unfiltered.

## Filtration Processes IWA Publishing
Slow sand filtration was the main method of filtration of potable water before rapid sand filtration was developed.Although it has a large footprint,many slow sand filters are still used.Developments to make them more cost effective have included: Sand removal,washing and replacement have been mechanised as much as possible.A23 Sand filtration for raw water or wastewater treatmentIt is finally used in some wastewater treatment plants where it provides initial effluent treatment.3) Use of rapid sand filters for effluent treatment.Sand filters for effluent treatment are used to filter wastewater by promoting the development of a biological activity that breaks down organic matter.
