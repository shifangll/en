## Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA)
Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) is an important management tool for ensuring optimal use of natural resources for sustainable development.A beginning in this direction was made in our country with the impact assessment of river valley projects in 79 and the scope has subsequently been enhanced to cover other developmental sectors.Western Ghats Ecology Expert PanelIndeed,as early as 2000,the Sen committee had called for systematically mapping and recording base line data for the entire country,as also to design and operationalize a comprehensive monitoring programme and network,involving not only government agencies but also other institutions,universities,NGOs,and individuals,particularly those.
