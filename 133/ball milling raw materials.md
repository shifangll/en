## Ball Milling
Ball milling technique,using mechanical alloying and mechanical milling approaches were proposed to the word wide in the 8th decade of the last century for preparing a wide spectrum of powder materials and their alloys.In fact,ball milling process is not new and dates back to more than 150 years.It has been used in size comminutions of ore,mineral dressing,preparing talc powders and many.ball milling JAC 图文 百度文库2016 6 19&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;It indicates that a single phase of Nd0.7 Sr0.3 MnO3 has been synthesized simply by milling raw materials for 4 h and also demonstrates that the high energy ball milling method can produce a stoichiometric and homogeneous manganite perovskites.The carbon
