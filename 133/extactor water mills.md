## water extraction mill
The application of ohmic heating for inulin extraction.The extraction is a crucial process for producing inulin powder from JAT.The most popular method for isolation of inulin from plants is hot water extraction because inulin is water soluble especially in hot water (Srinameb,Nuchadomrong,Jogloy,PEquipment Explained The Olive Oil SourceDisadvantagesThey are bulky.The stones are difficult to clean.Green olives prolong grinding time.They are expensive.The process is discontinuous,hence time consuming.The labor costs are high.A lower level of polyphenols is extracted so the shelf life of the oil is shorter (but as we saw above,the oil is less bitter.)HammermillsA hammermill has swinging arms that push the olives into.

The top slot in the Extractor GUI is the input slot; whatever material that is being extracted goes there.The bottom slot in the GUI is the Battery slot; if the Extractor is being used without a connection to an Energy Unit (EU) network,it may be powered using RE Batteries,BatPacks,or Single Use Batteries in this slot.Finally,the slot on the right is the output slot; extracted materials.Oil ExtractionRoman times until the eighteenth century,similar technology was used for oil extraction (1).In the eighteenth century,wind and water power largely replaced animal power to assist in oil extraction.Large wind driven stamper mills became popular in Europe.The wind turned a vane outside the oil mil

## Optimization of ultrasonic extraction of polysaccharides.
In this paper,the effects of ultrasonic power,extraction time,extraction temperature on the yield and the antioxidant activity of water soluble polysaccharides of Ziziphus jujuba Mill.were investigated by response surface methodology (RSM).RSM is an effective statistical technique,which is used to find optimum processing parameters [11 13].WatermillA watermill is an engine that uses a water wheel or turbine to drive a mechanical process such as flour or lumber production,or metal shaping (rolling,grinding or wire drawing).A watermill that only generates electricity is more usually called a hydroelectric plant
