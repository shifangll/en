2019 7 1&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Feasibility Of Beneficiation Of Banded Hematite Jasper Of Eastern India Mrs.Nirlipta P.Nayak1,Dr.Abhimanyu Das2 And Dr.B.K.Pal3 ABSTRACT Iron ore resource has its own typical mineral characteristics which require definite beneficiation process toHybrid intelligent control for regrinding process in.Thus,the sump level and the oscillations of the feeding pressure can be both controlled within their target ranges,respectively,and the feeding density can track its setpoint.The proposed method has been successfully applied to a regrinding process in a large scale hematite beneficiation plant.
