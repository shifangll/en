## Measuring Productivity in the Workplace: Production …
Minutes: A Simple Measure of Productivity (and Profitability Direction) By now you may be wondering how to do the minutes calculation.You have one question to answer before you do your calculation and that is: What operation(s) generate the greatest percentage of value added sales in your plant? In most cases,it is primarily production equipment.Equipment selection2019 6 28&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;The equipment selection process for an underground mine design plan has an extremely wide scope as there are a myriad of parameters to consider when incorporating mobile and stationary equipment in hard or soft rock mining applications.This article primarily focuses on the initial selection of mobile equipment in hard rock mining operations.

## Maintenance Management KPI’s
18&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Equipment Availability.Definition: “Equipment Utilization” measures the percentage of time a piece of equipment is actually operationally in a 24 hour day,for a given period of time.The performance measurement is the productive time expressed as a percentage of the total time available.Responsibility: The reporting of Equipment Utilization is the responsibility of the Production Controller.Measuring Maintenance Productivity2020 2 21&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;If that is the case,then how would we measure the productivity of our Maintenance Departments (or our maintainers)? For organisations in many asset intensive industries,maintenance costs can be a significant proportion of total operating costs (perhaps as high as 50% of total costs in some parts of the mining industry).
