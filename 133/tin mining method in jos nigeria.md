 · In Nigeria,extraction of tin dates as far back as 500 BC,where the Nok culture of the Benue Northern Zaria areas of Nigeria were understood to have knowledge of Iron smelting.More famously,however was the rise of the Benin Bronze casting in Ile Ife around 1400 AD,under the rule of Oba Ogunta,the Sixth king of Benin1.Economic Mineral Potentials Of Tailing Dumps From …Several tonnes of mine tailing dumps abound in the alluvial tin mining areas of the Jos Plateau.These tailings are considered low in contents of cassiterite,columbite,tantalite,zircon and other minerals normally won from tin mining.Four of these dumps in four different mines located in Barkin Ladi (BL),Gurum (GM),Sabon Gida Dan Yaya (SGDY) and Sabon Gida Kanar (SGK) have been studied to.

## The environmental implications of the exploration and.
In tin mining in Plateau,the open cast mining method was used because the plains of Plateau were flat and tin was concentrated in old stream beds and was washed down from the younger granite outcropping units (Gyang &amp; Ashano,2010).Tin was mined from the Jos Plateau,with the cassiterite mineral coming from the plateau highlands.Tin mining In Jos PlateauTin can be mined by using any of these four methods underground method,placer method,in situ mining and open cast or open pit method of mining.The open cast mining is a surface technique of extractingsolid mineral from the earth by removing the minerals from an open pit.This was the most common method used here in Jos Plateau.
