## Placer deposit
Placer mining is an important source of gold,and was the main technique used in the early years of many gold rushes,including the California Gold Rush.Types of placer deposits include alluvium,eluvium,beach placers,and paleoplacers.Placer materials must be both dense and resistant to weathering processes.What Is Placer Gold and Where Do I Find It?&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;Placer Gold: The Stuff You Gold Pan For.To start off,there are two types of gold deposits: lode and placer.Typically,lode deposits are the traditional veins of ore that are embedded in rocks and minerals.To recover gold from lodes,miners have to blast,mill,or treat the rock with chemicals to recover the gold inside.

## How Gold is Deposited into Placers
The gold in the gravels of the Klondike region differs from ordinary placer gold.It is often in large nuggets,including much quartz,and is usually rough and but little water worn.It is of low standard,and has resulted from the erosion of auriferous rocks by glaciers which have carried the broken material into the valleys and left them as moraines.GIS application in mineral resource.gold (Koschmann and Bergendahl,1968).Because of the huge amount of data in variety of forms accumulated from placer gold exploration and production over the past century,the analysis and management of these data for future development of the Nome offshore gold resource is an enormous task.GIS technology is a tool well suited to meet this.
