## by step extraction of copper
How copper is made material,used,processing,steps.The process of extracting copper from copper ore varies according to the type of ore and the desired purity of the final product.Each process consists of several steps in which unwanted materials are physically or chemically removed,and the concentration of copper is progressively increased.Copper Extraction from Sulfide OresModern copper metallurgy is based on the smelting process.Following steps are involved: i.CONCENTRATION OF THE ORE The finely powdered ore is concentrated by froth flotation process.The powdered ore is mixed with water and a small amount of pine oil (a foaming agent).This mixture is taken in a flotation tank.
