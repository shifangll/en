## Outgassing in Powder Coatings &gt; Powder Coated Tough
1.Castings: Outgassing can occur when a powder coating is applied over a cast metal surface (iron,steel,aluminum,brass,etc.).Gasses are entrapped into the casting material during the pouring process of both sand and die type castings.These gasses can be anything from entrapped air to gas formed during the cooling of the molten metal.The Difference Between Refined Salt and Unrefined …In fact,refined salt can sit on the grocery shelf forever.A long shelf life is a valuable tool to maximize profits for food manufacturers.2.Manufacturers believe that an all white salt product will look cleaner to the consumer and,therefore,increase sales.Refined salt is bleached in order to obtain the white color.3.
