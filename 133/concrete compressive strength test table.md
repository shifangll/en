## (PDF) Prediction of Compressive Strength of GGBS Concrete.
In concrete construction,it is necessary to ensure the compressive strength,based upon the material proportion added to it.The compressive strength of concrete is tested at the age of 28 days.Compression test on concreteThe most common test for hardened concrete is the compressive strength,at a particular period of time,from the time of casting the concrete cubes.It is very important for engineers and technicians to obtain accurate results of compressive strengths of concrete.
