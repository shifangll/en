## Hydrogen Sulfide Gas in Wastewater Aquafix
What is Hydrogen Sulfide? Hydrogen Sulfide (H 2 S) often is a colorless gas with a rotten egg odor,which is commonly referred to as ‘sewer gas’.Hydrogen Sulfide is highly poisonous and highly corrosive in wastewater applications.There are various problems associated with hydrogen sulfide generation,such as toxicity,noxious odors,and the generation of corrosive sulfuric acid.Hydrogen Sulfide Removal Pure Water Products,LLCHydrogen sulfide dissolved in water can also corrode plumbing metals,such as iron,steel,copper and brass and exposed metal parts in washing machines and other water using appliances.The corrosion of iron and steel from hydrogen sulfide forms ferrous sulfide or "black water" which can darken silverware and discolor copper and brass utensils.

## Hydrogen sulfide Wikipedia
The biochemistry of hydrogen sulfide is a key part of the chemistry of the iron sulfur world.In this model of the origin of life on Earth,geologically produced hydrogen sulfide is postulated as an electron donor driving the reduction of carbon dioxide.Whole House Iron Water Filter Hydrogen Sulfide Reduction."Iron Equivalent" is calculated as follows: (Iron level) + (2 x Manganese level) + (3 x Hydrogen sulfide level) If your level of Hydrogen sulfide is unknown (it is hard to accurately test for) and you have a noticeable "rotten egg" odor,assume a Hydrogen sulfide level of 0.5 ppm.If the rotten egg odor is severe,assume a level of 1.0 ppm.

Hydrogen sulfide,if present,will vary by well due to the varying geology.It is most common in shales and sandstones.The occurrence of hydrogen sulfide gas has been correlated to groundwater with low pH and groundwaterIs it sulphide or sulfide?As others have already pointed out.Both are sulphide (British English) and sulfide (American English) are both perfectly acceptable.However,what is interesting is that a number of text books in the UK are now using the American English spelling.

## Iron sulfide
2020 2 11&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Iron sulfide is the chemical compound FeS,a black solid.It is made of iron and sulfide ions.FeS has iron in its +2 oxidation state.It reacts with acids such as hydrochloric acid to make hydrogen sulfide gas.In plural,&quot;iron sulfides&quot; may refer to a range of chemical compounds composed of iron and sulfur.For example to FeS 2 (iron disulfide) found in the ground as the mineral pyrite.Removal of Manganese and Iron from Groundwater in the.30&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;The presence of iron,manganese,hydrogen sulfide and ammonia in ground and surface waters,can cause a number of problems that are related to the health safety of water.Iron and manganese are colourless in the dis solved form,but in contact with air turn into an insoluble form,and their deposition causes reddish or brown
