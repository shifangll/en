## Optimizing and evaluating the operational factors.
This research was carried out on Aghdareh gold ore.The Aghdareh mine and gold processing plant is located 32 km from Takab city in the western Azerbaijan province,Iran,at 46&#176;58′30′′N and 36&#176;39′29′′E.The grade of gold ore is 3 ppm.Also,cyanide leaching is used to process gold in the Aghdareh mine.The main problem in.What is the use of cyanide?Many,actually.The most generally known industrial activities where cyanide is used are gold mining and electroplating.What a lot of people don’t know is that the plastic industry uses the largest amount of hydrogen cyanide.Think of the thermal.

## Gold processing Britannica
27&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Gold processing,preparation of the ore for use in various products.For thousands of years the word gold has connoted something of beauty or value.These images are derived from two properties of gold,its colour and its chemical stability.The colour of gold is due to the electronic structure of the gold atom,which absorbs electromagnetic radiation with wavelengths less than 5600 angstroms.Cyanide Use in Gold MiningCyanide's efficiency makes mining more wasteful.Because cyanide leaching is very efficient,it allows profitable mining of much lower ore grades.Mining lower grade ore requires the extraction and processing of much more ore to get the same amount of gold.Partially due to cyanide,modern mines are.much larger than before cyanide was used;

Clean Mining Ltd,an Australian technology company,announced the world’s first breakthrough technology to eliminate the use of cyanide from gold ore processing at the 3 rd Asia Pacific Precious Conference held in Singapore.Traditionally,gold mining has depended on harsh chemicals such as cyanide and mercury to extract gold from ore.Gold processing 101In most cases,gold processing with cyanide leaching,usually with carbon adsorption,is still the core technology and the critical thing is understanding the mineralogy in order to optimise flowsheet selection and cost drivers,and get the best out of the process.Metallurgy: the …

2020 2 25&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;For extracting gold from low grade ores,heap leaching is practiced; huge heaps are sprayed with a dilute solution of sodium cyanide,and this percolates down through the piled ore,dissolving the gold.There are very well defined rules for the safe and responsible use of cyanide as laid out in the International Cyanide Code.Gold refiningHow is cyanide used in gold mining?Cyanidation is used to extract gold from a finely ground ore material in a mix with water at about 55% solids by mass.Gold extraction is always a surface processing based extraction process and has nothing to do with the process of Mining itself.
