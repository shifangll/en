## Ball mill for bauxite grinding
Ball mill Wikipedia.The ball mill is a key piece of equipment for grinding crushed materials and it is widely used in production lines for powders such as cement silicates refractory material fertilizer glass ceramics etc as well as for ore dressing of both ferrous and nonferrous metals The ball mill can grind various ores and other materials either wetEffect of Adjusting for Particle Size Distribution of.2.2.Approach.To evaluate the effect of the classifications of particle size distribution of cement,the mix proportion was newly required.Nine mix proportions by the amount of different sizes of cement were classified based on the accumulated remains denoted as R at 10 m (R10),20 m (R20),40 m (R40),and 80 m (R80) using an
