## Rod mills,how they function
Rod mills are very similar to ball mills,except they use long rods for grinding media.The rods grind the ore by tumbling within the the mill,similar to the grinding balls in a ball mill.To prevent the conditions leading to rod charge tangling,the length to diameter ratio is maintained at 1.4 to 1.6.Ball MillRETSCH is the world leading manufacturer of laboratory ball mills and offers the perfect product for each application.The High Energy Ball Mill E max and MM 500 were developed for grinding with the highest energy input.The innovative design of both,the mills and the grinding jars,allows for continuous grinding down to the nano range in the.
