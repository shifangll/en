## Sugar production from cane sugar
2017 7 31&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;The basic process Sugar cane must be crushed to extract the juice.The crushing process must break up the hard nodes of the cane and flatten the stems.The juice is collected,filtered and sometimes treated and then boiled to drive off the excess water.The dried cane residue (bagasse) is often used as fuel for this process.Tracked Crusher for construction waste and concrete15&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Tracked crusher is a stable,safe and reliable crawler type of crushing and screening machine which is excellent for recycling construction waste,asphalt,bricks,and concrete,and other demolition materials,as well as medium hard natural ore and glass.Transport size,weight,and compact construction make transportation even more convenient,which gives the mobile crusher great flexibility.
