## CNC Milling: Introduction to cutting tools wikimal
In end milling,the cutter generally rotates on an axis vertical to the workpiece.Cutting teeth are located on both the end face of the cutter and the periphery of the cutter body.A ball nose end mill,also known as a spherical end mill or ball end mill,has a semisphere at the tool end.Ball mill WikipediaOne such process is end milling.End milling primarily differs from other milling processes due to the type of tooling that is used for abrading a given material.Unlike cutters and drill bits,end mills have cutting teeth on the sides and end of the mill.Additionally,the milling applications for the end mill …
