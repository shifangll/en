## Arsenic in Complex Orebodies Ausenco
There is an increasing trend in the extraction and development of copper resources from complex deposits.The complex deposits pose mineral processing challenges,as they often contain low grade copper ore,relatively large quantity of clay minerals,complex texture,very fine disseminated ore,high amount of pyrite,and high level of impurity elements such as arsenic.Copper OresEnargite from Longfellow mine,Ouray County,Colorado,shiny black crystals of a copper arsenic sulphide ore.(Copper Arsenic Sulphide Cu 3 AsS 4).(Ph ack Weidrich Minerals) 2576: Erythrite as small but sharp purple crystals generously covering a black cobaltite matrix from Bou Azzer,Morocco.Erythrite is a cobalt arsenic ore (Co 3.
