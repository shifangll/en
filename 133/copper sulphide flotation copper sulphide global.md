## Sulfide Ores
Copper sulfide ores must be concentrated before they can be economically transported and smelted.The universal technique for this concentration is froth flotation of finely ground ore.Froth flotation entails attaching fine Cu sulfide mineral particles to bubbles and floating them out of a water ore mixture.Oxidative Hydrometallurgy of Sulphide Minerals2018 9 25&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Oxidative Hydrometallurgy of Sulphide Minerals F.R.Carrillo Pedroza,M.J.So ria Aguilar,E.Salinas Rodr&#237;guez,A.Mart&#237;nez Luevanos,T.E.Pecina Trevi&#241;o and A.D&#225;valos S&#225;nchez Autonomous University of Coahuila,Mexico 1.Introduction Sulphide minerals are one of the most important sources of value metals,such as gold,

## Optimization of parameters affecting recovery of copper.
In this work,the parameters affecting the recovery of copper from the low grade sulfide minerals of Sarcheshmeh Copper Mine were studied.A low grade sulfide ore was used with a copper grade of 0.25%,which was about 28% of the mineral oxide,and the sulfide minerals made up the rest.Much more sulfidesulphide Archives10&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;DRA Global says it has been awarded the bankable feasibility study (BFS) contract for the Managem Group owned Tizert copper project,in the Souss Massa province of Morocco.The Tizert copper deposit is located on the northern edge of Igherm Precambrian buttonhole and is the largest copper deposit in the western Anti Atlas Copper Belt,according.

## Copper LPF Leach Precipitation and Flotation Process
Approximately 40% of the total copper occurs in non sulphide form.Metallurgical tests conducted on the ore showed that sulphidization was ineffective to recover a significant part of the oxidized copper.However,the leach precipitation flotation process,commonly referred to as LPF,was shown to be economically feasible.Copper Sulfide Ore Flotation Technologies XinhaiCopper sulfide ore has good inherent floatability,so flotation process is a mature method used for copper sulfide ore separation.In recent years,with the continuous development of copper sulphide flotation technology,many scholars also proposed a series of new principles of mineral processing,such as “collect early,loss early” and “more crushing and less grinding”.
