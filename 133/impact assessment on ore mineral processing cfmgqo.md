## The environmental impact of gold production
This indicates that attempts to lessen the environmental impact of gold production should focus on these two stages.Mining and comminution are highly dependent on the grade of gold ore,as the lower the grade,the greater the amount that needs to be mined and the more crushing and grinding is required to extract the gold from the ore.Mineral processing metallurgy Britannica2020 2 25&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Mineral processing,art of treating crude ores and mineral products in order to separate the valuable minerals from the waste rock,or gangue.It is the first process that most ores undergo after mining in order to provide a more concentrated material for the procedures of extractive metallurgy.
