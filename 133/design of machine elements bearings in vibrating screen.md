## FUNdaMENTALS of Design
Bearings Bearings are machine elements that allow compo nents to move with respect to each other.Bearings are used to support large skyscrap ers to allow them to move during earthquakes,and bearings enable the finest of watches to tick away happily.Without bearings,every thing would grind to a halt,including people,whoseCoupling misalignment dampens precision machinery vibrationThis unbalance produces vibration inside bearings within the bearing clearances.These clearances range up to 1 mill (0.001 in.) for rolling element bearings and 3 to 8 mills in plain bearings.

## What are Machine Elements? Classification of Machine …
All the machines are made up of elements or parts and each element may have to be designed separately and in assembly.The two main types of machine elements: general purpose elements like nuts,bolts,bearings,couplings,fasteners and special purpose elements like piston,crankshaft etc.Vibrating Screen Design&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Dear All,Could anybody advise me as to how should I carry out calculations for a screening system.What I mean is : A vibrating screen ( 2 bearing design) has an eccentric shaft and 2 counter weights at the shaft ends.I would like to know what should be the amount of eccentricity on the shaft and how much should be the weights at the end.
