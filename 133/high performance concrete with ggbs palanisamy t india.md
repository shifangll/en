## Ground granulated blast furnace slag
16&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Ground granulated blast furnace slag (GGBS or GGBFS) is obtained by quenching molten iron slag (a by product of iron and steel making) from a blast furnace in water or steam,to produce a glassy,granular product that is then dried and ground into a fine powder.Ground granulated blast furnace slag is highly cementitious and high in CSH (calcium silicate hydrates) which is a strength enhancing.Design of self compacting concrete with ground …The use of GGBS as a cementitious material as well as fine filler is being increasingly advocated for the production of High Performance Concrete (HPC),Roller Compacted Concrete (RCC) and self compacting concrete (SCC),etc.design of self compacting concrete with ground granulated blast furnace slag (GGBS) for percentage replacements.
