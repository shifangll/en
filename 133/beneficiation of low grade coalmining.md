## Beneficiation of a Low Grade Titanomagnetite Ore in Mining.
Beneficiation of a low grade titanomagnetite ore containing 18.52%Fe and 6.65%TiO2 was conducted by dry and wet low intensity magnetic separators.Effects of different variables,such as magnetic intensity,grinding fineness and stages of separation,were investigated in details.The ore was firstly preconcentrated by a dry low intensity magnetic separator (DLMS) at a magnetic intensity of.Initial metallurgical tests are suggesting that the low grade Kaiser Bill ore can be pre concentrated,which should lead to lower capital and operating costs.Because this is an open cuttable large lowgrade deposit,the mill site and tailings dam will be sited near Kaiser Bill.
