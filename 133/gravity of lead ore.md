## Galena
23&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Galena is the main ore of lead,used since ancient times.Because of its somewhat low melting point,it was easy to liberate by smelting.It typically forms in low temperature sedimentary deposits.In some deposits the galena contains about 1 2% silver,a byproduct that far outweighs the main lead ore in revenue.In these deposits significant amounts of silver occur as included silver sulfide.gravity pre concentration lead zinc ore irsil.orggravity pre concentration lead zinc ore Gold Mining Process Development &#187; Denver Mineral EngineersTHE BASIC PROCESSES OF GOLD RECOVERY INTRODUCTION.Man has held a.
