## Classification of Mineral Deposits Geology for Investors
Geologists,are known to have more opinions than economists,so it should come as no surprise that the classification of mineral deposits,is an on going hot topic.The details will be debated until the sun cools,but the broad brush classification of mineral deposits is generally understood.Why Do Classification Systems Matter?A thematic issue dedicated to the giant Golden Mile …The Kalgoorlie district in the Archean Yilgarn Craton of Western Australia comprises the Golden Mile (1767 t Au to Dec.2018),Mt Charlotte (153 t Au) and smaller gold deposits (23 t Au combined; Keats 1987).Kalgoorlie was established in 1893,when Patrick Hannan,Thomas Flanagan and Dan Shea discovered alluvial gold.
