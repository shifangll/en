## Comparing Used Ball Mills Vs Used Rod Mills
In a ball mill the actual balls in the machine need to cascade in order for the grinding to be accomplished.Because of this more energy is needed to power up a ball press as opposed to a rod press.Rod mills can be operated at lower peripheral speeds resulting in reduced energy costs.Barrel Mill Eriez Lab EquipmentVariously known as a Barrel Mill,a Swing Mill,a Ring Mill or a Stone and Disc Mill,this highly efficient grinding machine comprises a steel vessel containing a solid steel bar (stone) and one or two steel rings,which oscillate with a rotary motion to grind materials from approximately 10 mm
