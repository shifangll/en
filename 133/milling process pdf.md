## Milling Process,Defects,Equipment
The milling process requires a milling machine,workpiece,fixture,and cutter.The workpiece is a piece of pre shaped material that is secured to the fixture,which itself is attached to a platform inside the milling machine.The cutter is a cutting tool with sharp teeth that is also secured in the milling machine and rotates at high speeds.CNC Machining &amp; Milling Process Ardel Engineering16&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;The milling process can produce shaping as well as details in a piece: shapes,slots,holes,notches,grooves,pockets,and specialty faces are all results of custom millwork.As a cutter works a piece,the tool’s edges make countless small,quick cuts in the material to sculpt its surface.The shaved off pieces from each pass are called.
