## Carbon Steel vs.Cast Iron Pans: What's the Difference?
You might think that cast iron is made of pure iron,but it's not.Cast iron is actually an alloy of iron and carbon,just like steel,with the main difference being that cast iron has more carbon in it.Whereas steel requires a carbon content of no more than 2 percent,cast iron usually contains 2 to 3.5 percent carbon.Metal Profile: Iron Properties and CharacteristicsIron was once the primary structural material,but it has since been replaced by steel in most applications.Nevertheless,cast iron is still used in pipes and automotive parts like cylinder heads,cylinder blocks,and gearbox cases.Wrought iron is still used to produce home decor items,such as wine racks,candle holders,and curtain rods.

## Iron and steel
Pure iron is too soft and reactive to be of much real use,so most of the &quot;iron&quot; we tend to use for everyday purposes is actually in the form of iron alloys: iron mixed with other elements (especially carbon) to make stronger,more resilient forms of the metal including steel.Broadly speaking,steel ‚Ä¶FERRONIOBIUM ALLOYING TECHNIQUES IN IRON &amp; ‚Ä¶10&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;FERRONIOBIUM ALLOYING TECHNIQUES IN IRON &amp; STEEL MAKING PHYSICAL PROPERTIES OF FERRONIOBIUM Niobium alloying in iron and steel materials is done in most applications by adding ferroniobium into molten iron during secondary metallurgical treatment in a ladle [1].Ferroniobium is typically
