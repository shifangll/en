## Nitrogen assimilation
23&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Nitrogen assimilation Last updated Decem.Nitrogen assimilation is the formation of organic nitrogen compounds like amino acids from inorganic nitrogen compounds present in the environment.Organisms like plants,fungi and certain bacteria that cannot fix nitrogen gas (N 2) depend on the ability to assimilate nitrate or ammonia for their needs.Other organisms,like animals.High Affinity Manganese Uptake by the Metal.In contrast with many other essential metals,the mechanisms of Mn acquisition in higher eukaryotes are seldom studied and poorly understood.We show here that Arabidopsis thaliana relies on a high affinity uptake system to acquire Mn from the soil in conditions of low Mn availability and that this activity is catalyzed by the divalent metal transporter NRAMP1 (for Natural Resistance.
