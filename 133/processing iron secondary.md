The making of cast iron begins with a combination of raw materials.Iron is rarely found in its pure form.Only meteorites contain pure iron.The iron in use for centuries is found in the combination of iron and other elements.These combinations are known as iron oxides.Mining pulls most of the iron from iron …Solvent extraction in the primary and secondary …27&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Solvent extraction in the primary and secondary processing of zinc subject of investigation for some time.Interestingly,however,the first commercial application of zinc SX on the mainstream process liquor will be for the exploitation of an oxide orebody.Sulphide ores and concentrates Most zinc ores occur as sulphides and,as such,are amenable
