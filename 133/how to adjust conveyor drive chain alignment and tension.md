## Design &amp; Solve: How to Properly Tension a Chain …
A critical step in maintaining equipment with roller chain and sprockets is to routinely inspect drives for correct chain tension.You can also routinely inspect roller chain for elongation using a gauge which compares the true chain pitch to the original pitch.Most chain manufacturers recommend replacing the chain after three percent elongation.Plant Engineering Tensioning belt drivesDrive tensioning can impose a load on the structure that supports the motor,reducer,and other driven equipment.For example,the static drive belt tension between a 100 hp,1760 rpm motor and the driven shaft can easily exceed 2500 lb.A 20 hp drive running at 50 rpm at the output shaft of a reducer could have a belt tension over 16,000 lb.
