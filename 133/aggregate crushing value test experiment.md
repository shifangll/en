## What is the significance of ten percent fines value in.
The test aims at looking for the forces required to produce 10% of fine values (i.e.weight of fines aggregates weight of all aggregates = 10%).This test is very similar to Aggregate Crushing Test in which a standard force 400kN is applied and fines material expressed asExperiment On Aggregate Crushing ValueExperiment On Aggregate Crushing Value.Procedure to determine aggregate impact value i the cup of the impact testing machine should be fixed firmly in position on the base of the machine and the whole of the test sample placed in it and compacted by 25 strokes of the tamping rod.
