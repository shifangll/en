## Mill (grinding)
SAG is an acronym for semi autogenous grinding.SAG mills are autogenous mills that also use grinding balls like a ball mill.A SAG mill is usually a primary or first stage grinder.SAG mills use a ball charge of 8 to 21%.The largest SAG mill is 42' (12.8m) in diameter,powered by a 28 MW (38,000 HP) motor.INDUSTRIAL CASE STUDY THE EMENT INDUSTRYINDUSTRIAL CASE STUDY: THE CEMENT INDUSTRY.Energy Use Type California U.S.CA share of U.S.United States Industrial Motor Systems Market Opportunities
