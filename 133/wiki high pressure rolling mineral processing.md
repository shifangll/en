## High pressure pipes SKF
SKF High pressure pipes can be used when SKF Oil injection equipment cannot be connected directly to a pressure joint.Typically they are used for non bearing applications where the oil injection pressure is in excess of 150 MPa (21 750psi).They consist of a steel pipe with a steel ball fitted to both ends.How Aluminum is Produced2019 8 16&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Smelting: In 1886,two 22 year old scientists on opposite sides of the Atlantic,Charles Hall of the USA and Paul L.T.Heroult of France,made the same discovery molten cryolite (a sodium aluminum fluoride mineral) could be used to dissolve alumina and the resulting chemical reaction would produce metallic aluminum.

## Mill (grinding) Wikipedia
A mill is a device that breaks solid materials into smaller pieces by grinding,crushing,or cutting.Such comminution is an important unit operation in many processes.There are many different types of mills and many types of materials processed in them.Historically mills were powered by hand (e.g.via a hand crank),working animal (e.g.horse mill),wind or water ().Powder metallurgy WikipediaPowder metallurgy (PM) is a term covering a wide range of ways in which materials or components are made from metal powders.PM processes can avoid,or greatly reduce,the need to use metal removal processes,thereby drastically reducing yield losses in manufacture and often resulting in lower costs.Powder metallurgy is also used to make unique materials impossible to get from melting or.
