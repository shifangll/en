## FUNdaMENTALS of Design
2&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;lower the friction force and the greater the efficiency of the system.• The pressure caused by the load acting on the contact area stresses the materials and causes them to slowly wear.The lower the contact pressure and the lower the sliding velocity,the longer the bearing will last.The energy efficiency of ball milling in comminution.Earlier work by Fuerstenau and Kapur on the comminution of quartz in a single particle roll mill and in a dry ball mill showed the energy efficiency of ball mill comminution to be 22%.Thus,as a mechanical device for producing fine particles,the ball mill is reasonably efficient energetically.
