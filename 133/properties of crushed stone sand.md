## Replacement of Natural Sand by Crushed Sand in the.
Nowadays it is very important to make the concrete economical.Therefore the present work has initiated to make the concrete economical by replacing the natural sand by crushed sand in the concrete.From our study it is concluded that different Crushed sand gives different results for compressive strength depending on different quarries and from study of different research paper at 40% to 50%.Some properties of crushed stone for road. SpringerLinkIt is not yet possible to express the surface texture on the microscale in a number.The resistance to polishing of aggregates can,however,be expressed as the polished stone value which is determined in the laboratory using an apparatus for accelerated polishing.
