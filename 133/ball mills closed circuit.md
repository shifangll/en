## Tube Mill
Tube mills can be operated in open or closed circuit.In an open circuit there are no auxiliary units,such as separator and bucket elevator.This minimises the capital expenditure and maintenance requirement.The closed circuit offers process technological and energy effectiveness advantages.JKSimMet Course&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;• SAG Discharge screen U S feeds a cyclone cluster.• Cyclone underflow feeds a ball mill in closed circuit.• There are water additions to the SAG feed,Cyclone Feed,and Ball Mill Feed.Experiment with adding Info Blocks to your flowsheet 17.James Didovich 2014 JKSimMet V6 19 Ex F3: SABC Circuit 18.

The reference point is a conventional ball mill circuit in closed circuit with cyclones operating at 250% circulating load and having 38% of fine material reporting to cyclone underflow,resulting in a classification efficiency of 50%.This efficiency was chosen as an industrial practice “average” from …AMIT 135: Lesson 6 Grinding Circuit Mining Mill …AG SAG mills can accomplish the same size reduction work as two or three stages of crushing and screening,a rod mill,and some or all of the work of a ball mill.Because of the range of mill sizes available,AG SAG milling can often be accomplished with fewer lines than in a conventional rod mill ball mill circuit.A diagram of types of AG SAG.
