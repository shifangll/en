## An investigation on the kinetics of chromium …
The chromium extraction efficiency from chromite ore was calculated using the following equation (Sun et al.2009): (2) Pct conversion = 1 − Cr r Cr 0 &#215; 100 where [Cr] r and [Cr] 0 were the concentrations of chromium in the residues and that in chromite ore,respectively.Chromium Mining Processing Equipment Flow Chart.Chromium (Cr) is a hard,bluish metallic element.The only ore of chromium is the mineral chromite and 99 percent of the world’s chromite is found in southern Africa and Zimbabwe.Geologists estimate that there are about 11 billion tons of mineable chromite ore in the world,enough to supply the current demand for hundreds of years.
