## Tension in timing belt drives Machine Design
In practice,a belt drive can be designed such that the desired slack side tension equals about 10 to 30% of effective tension.This gives proper tooth meshing during operation.Belt Tension Meter RTM,Trummeter27&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Preferably,the belt tension should always be measured at the center of the longer belt strand between the two drive pulleys.The distance to the belt can be 3 20 mm.Depending upon ambient light and surface of belt,the measurement can occur from a distance of max.60 mm,whereas darker light and better reflection (can be obtained by.

## How to Tension a V Belt (&amp; How Not to)
The proper tension is the lowest tension at which the belt won’t slip or squeal under peak load.However,there is still a wide range of tension between these two extremes in which a drive will operate sufficiently.The primary goal of learning how to tension a V belt is to find this happy tension medium.Belt TensionRobin Kent,in Energy Management in Plastics Processing (Third Edition),2018.Improvement.The efficiency of standard V belts will decrease over time from a peak of 95 98% to less than 93% due to ageing and failure to adjust the belt tension.Cogged belts have a greatly reduced bending resistance compared to standard V belts and can be used on the same pulleys as equivalent V belts.
