Polished concrete cost can vary depending on the condition of the concrete,the level of polishing (gloss or matte),the size or area of the floor,and the access (new or old construction).Most concrete polishing prices are based on how many times the polishing contractor thinks he she has to grind or hone the concrete floor to get it to a smooth surface.
