The IsaMill is a stirred medium grinding mill,in which the grinding medium and the ore being ground are stirred rather than being subjected to the tumbling action of older high throughput mills (such as ball mills and rod mills).Stirred mills often consist of stirrers mounted on a rotating shaft located along the central axis of the mill.Overview IndustriesThe production of very fine particles by grinding coarse particles is referred to as the dispersion method or &quot;top down&quot; process.For such grinding tasks,high energy densities such as those realized in agitator bead mills must be available.They are employed in many branches of industry for grinding raw materials into the nanometer range as.
