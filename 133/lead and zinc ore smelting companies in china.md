Plants for the production of lead are generally referred to as lead smelters.Primary lead production begins with sintering.Concentrated lead ore is fed into a sintering machine with iron,silica,limestone fluxes,coke,soda ash,pyrite,zinc,caustics or pollution control particulates.Smelting uses suitable reducing substances that will combine with those oxidizing elements to free the metal.Zinc smelting WikipediaZinc smelting is the process of converting zinc concentrates (ores that contain zinc) into pure zinc.Zinc smelting has historically been more difficult than the smelting of other metals,e.g.iron,because in contrast,zinc has a low boiling point.At temperatures typically used for smelting metals,zinc is a gas that will escape from a.
