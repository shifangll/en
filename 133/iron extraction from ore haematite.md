## EXTRACTION OF IRON EXTRACTION OF IRON FROM HAEMATITE
Iron is extracted from its oxide: ore called HAEMATITE (Fe 2 O 3).PRINCIPLE OF EXTRACTION : Extraction of iron is based on the reduction of HAEMATITE (Fe 2 O 3) with carbon.DETAILS OF EXTRACTION : The process of the extraction of iron is carried out by the following steps: Concentration of ore Calcination or Roasting of ore.Extraction of Iron from Haematite Lets Learn NepalExtraction of Iron: Iron is extracted from its chief ore Haematite Fe 2 O 3.The various steps involved in the process are as follows: 1.Crushing: The ores are crushed in jaw crusher and powdered in ball mills.2.Concentration: The crushed ore is washed with steam or cold water to remove clay and sand.The washed ore is then concentrated by electromagnetic separation process.

## Iron ore: Confounding the expectations of experts Edison
 · Where do we extract iron ore from? We predominantly mine two types of rock for iron ore: haematite (iron III oxide) and magnetite (iron II,III oxide).In general,both are found as sedimentary deposits in rocks that are at least 1.8bn years old and thought to be the product of iron rich waters at a time when oxygen was rare in oceans and rivers.GCSE CHEMISTRY Extraction of Iron Haematite.Extraction of Metals.Extraction of Iron.Iron is extracted from its ore in the blast furnace.The main iron ore is called haematite.Haematite is iron(III) oxide Fe 2 O 3.The iron ore contains impurities,mainly silica (silicon dioxide).Limestone (calcium carbonate) is added to the iron ore which reacts with the silica to form molten calcium silicate in the blast furnace.
