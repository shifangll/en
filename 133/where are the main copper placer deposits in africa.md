## Placer deposit
22&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;In geology,a placer deposit or placer is an accumulation of valuable minerals formed by gravity separation from a specific source rock during sedimentary processes.The name is from the Spanish word placer,meaning &quot;alluvial sand&quot;.Placer mining is an important source of gold,and was the main technique used in the early years of many gold rushes,including the California Gold Rush.Placer DepositCoastal placer deposits in the China Seas mainly exist in sandy and sandy gravel coasts and formed primarily during the late Pleistocene and Holocene (Liu,1989).Chen,Yang,et al.(2006) summarized distributions and divisions of placer deposits and ferromanganese nodules crusts in the sea areas of China and outlined 3 prospecting zones and 24 divisions of the placer deposits (Figure 7.39).
