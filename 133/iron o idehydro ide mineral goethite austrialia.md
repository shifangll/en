## Goethite
Goethite is an iron oxyhydroxide containing ferric iron.It is the main component of rust and bog iron ore.Goethite’s hardness ranges from 5.0 to 5.5 on the Mohs scale,and its specific gravity varies from 3.3 to 4.3.The mineral forms prismatic needle like crystals (“needle iron ore”),but is more typically massive."treated" Crystals minerals,Stones,crystals,Minerals.Fluorite may be the world's most colourful mineral,because of the enormous range of brilliant and even iridescent colours it displays.The funny thing is,pure fluorite crystals are transparent.Fluorite is the mineral form of calcium What Is Fluorite?
