## What is the calorific value of sludge in waste water
The calorific value is the measurement of heat or energy produced,and is measured either as gross calorific value or net calorific value.The difference being the latent heat of condensation of.coal facts,information,pictures Encyclopedia.com articles about coalCoal is classified according to its heating value and according to the percentage of carbon it contains.For example,anthracite contains the highest proportion of pure carbon (about 86 to 98 percent) and has the highest heat value (13,500 to 15,600 Btu lb; British thermal units per pound) of all forms of coal.Bituminous coal&nbsp;.
