## 8 Principles of Centerless Grinding
A downside of centerless grinding is you can’t have as many multiple axes operating on the workpieces.However,there are many parts where the process addresses the limitations of machining in terms of dimensions,materials,and surface finishes.That’s why we like to say that where machining ends,the centerless grinding process begins.
