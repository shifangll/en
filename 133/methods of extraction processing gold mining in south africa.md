## Extraction of Resources Geology
Mining is the extraction of valuable minerals or other geological materials from the earth from an orebody,lode,vein,seam,or reef,which forms the mineralized package of economic interest to the miner.Ores recovered by mining include metals,coal,oil shale,gemstones,limestone,dimension stone,rock salt,potash,gravel,and clay.Mining is required to obtain any material that cannot.Gold Extraction Process,Gold Mining Equipment,…With the rising gold prices in recent years,it further stimulated the rapid development of gold industry.As the exhaustion of high grade gold ore,researching on middle low grade and refractory gold ore and strengthen the traditional gold beneficiation undoubtedly have become the main trend in global gold beneficiation industry.
