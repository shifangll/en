## Coal Process Control Mineral Processing
Coal Sorting.Coal sorting is a process of separating a single coal stream into two or more streams of different qualities.Coal sorting reduces the total tonnes of coal which has to be washed,assisting the mine's profitability by: Reducing the capital cost of a green field site,allowing total output to be achieved with a smaller washeryDownloadsWith Heyl Patterson’s torrefaction equipment,wood retains up to 90% of its energy value.This energy dense end product can be used as a replacement for coal or co fired with coal in electric power plants.This manmade coal can provide energy rates of up to 23.7 million BTU per ton.Natural coal generally provides 28.4 million BTU per ton.
