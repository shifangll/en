## Raw Material Drying Grinding
Dry Grinding: Open circuit Ball mill,closed circuit Ball mill,vertical roller mill,Roll Press or Roll press in circuit with ball mill However,it would be seen that the most significant process and types used for raw material grinding operations in modern cement industry are:RawmillA raw mill is the equipment used to grind raw materials into &quot;rawmix&quot; during the manufacture of cement.Rawmix is then fed to a cement kiln,which transforms it into clinker,which is then ground to make cement in the cement mill.The raw milling stage of the process effectively defines the chemistry (and therefore physical properties) of the finished cement,and has a larg

## Cement
Cement Cement Extraction and processing: Raw materials employed in the manufacture of cement are extracted by quarrying in the case of hard rocks such as limestones,slates,and some shales,with the aid of blasting when necessary.Some deposits are mined by underground methods.Softer rocks such as chalk and clay can be dug directly by excavators.CHAPTER 3.0 CEMENT MANUFACTURING PROCESS3&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Material from the limestone and additive hoppers are fed to respective weigh feeders which weigh and feed the material as per the set ratio and quantity,which is then fed to the raw mill inlet with the help of belt conveyors.Two types of Raw Mills are used for grinding raw material i.e.ball mill and vertical roller mill (VRM).

## Cement Manufacturing Process: What is Cement made of.
Methods of Manufacturing Process of Cement.At present Portland Cement is manufactured by two processes,Dry Process,and Wet Process.The main difference between these two methods of manufacturing of cement is that in the dry process,calcareous and argillaceous raw materials are fed into the burning kilns in a perfectly dry state.Difference between Wet and Dry process of cement we.&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;Wet process Mixing of Raw materials in wash mill with 35 to 50% water.Materials exiting the mill are called &quot;slurry&quot; and have flow ability characteristics.Size of the kiln needed for manufacturing of cement is bigger.Raw material can be mixed easily,so a better homogeneous material can be obtained Fuel consumption is high i.e.…
