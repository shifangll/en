## Calculate Quantities of Materials for Concrete Cement.
Fa = Mass of fine aggregates.Ca = Mass of coarse aggregates.S c,S fa and S ca are the specific gravities of cement,fine aggregates and coarse aggregates respectively.The air content has been ignored in this calculation.This method of calculation for quantities of materials for concrete takes into account the mix proportions from design mix or nominal mixes for structural strength and.What is the ratio of cement sand and gravel? AnswersDriveThe ratio of aggregate to sand to cement is an important factor in determining the compressive strength of the concrete mixture.A concrete mixture ratio of 1 part cement,3 parts sand,and 3 parts aggregate will produce a concrete mix of approximately 3000 psi.
