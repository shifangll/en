## MPR: A timeline of Minnesota's Iron Range
Minnesota's Iron Range was formed some two billion years ago,and its rich iron ore deposits have been mined since the mid 1800s.Here are some notable events in the history of the area.IRON ORE DEPOSITS The Handbook of Texas Online Texas.Iron ore deposits of two kinds occur in Texas in two general areas: magnetic iron ores in the central mineral region and brown ores (limonite,goethite,and hematite) in northeastern Texas.Iron is found in considerable quantities in the area of Burnet,Llano,and Gillespie counties,the most notable deposit being that at Iron Mountain in Llano.

## 20.1 Metal Deposits Physical Geology
Most of the world’s major iron deposits are of the banded iron formation type,and most of these formed during the initial oxygenation of Earth’s atmosphere between 2,400 and 1,800 Ma.At that time,iron that was present in dissolved form in the ocean (as Fe2+) became oxidized to its insoluble form (Fe3+) and accumulated on the sea floor.Division of Geology and Mineral ResourcesIron occurs as a variety of minerals across the state of Virginia,but mining operations prior to the Civil War exclusively used a type of ore known as limonite.Limonite is a hydrated iron oxide with a general formula FeO(OH)·nH2O,commonly a byproduct of the weathering of iron rich sulfide or silicate minerals.
