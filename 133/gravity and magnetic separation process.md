## Electromagnetic Separation Mineral Processing & Metallurgy
The rougher tests of both the gravity separation and magnetic separation produced concentrates of about 44% Fe.Each of these two concentrates was cleaned in a second stage of processing using.Magnetic Separation Equipment Tubes,Grates,Plates.Magnetic Separation is the process of removing ferrous metal contaminants from a flowing product.Removal of this metal contamination (also known as tramp metal or tramp iron),is essential in order to safeguard your product purity and also protect your processing equipment from costly damage.

## Density Separation an overview ScienceDirect Topics
Magnetic density separation (MDS) is a density based sorting process realized utilizing a “magnetic fluid” constituted by a liquid (i.e.water) and magnetic particles (i.e.iron oxide particles of about 10 20 nm) suspended in the liquid (Bakker et al.2009).Through a special magnetic field (Rem et al.2013) an artificial gravity is produced,as a magnetic force.Dense Media Separation (DMS) Plants13&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Use magnetic separation,flotation or gravity separation to recover the medium solid in the dilute medium,and then dehydrated and concentrated by means of a water cyclone and finally reconfigured into a suspension with a proper density to return to the process.
