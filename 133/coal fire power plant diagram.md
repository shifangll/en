## Supercritical coal plant
17&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Supercritical coal plants are a type of coal fired power plant used in more modern designs.They differ from traditional coal power plants because the water running through it works as a supercritical fluid,meaning it is neither a liquid or a gas.This occurs when water reaches its critical point under high pressures and temperatures,specifically at 22 MPa and 374 o C.Lecture 3 Coal Power Plantsapdf LECTURE 3 COAL POWER,Coal is the world’s most abundant and widely distributed fossil fuel Reserves for all types of coal estimated to be about 900 billion tonnes Estimated to be enough for 100 250 years at current consumption It plays an essential role in our global energy mix,particularly for power generation,providing over 42% of global electricity supply At the same time,coal power plants account,

## Conventional Coal Fired Power Plant an overview,
Integration of post combustion CO 2 capture (PCC) technology with conventional coal fired power plants leads to a significant loss in power plant power production,ranging from 195% to 40% of their original output (Bert Metz et al,2005; Thambimuthu et al,2002; Page et al,2009)This penalty is due to two main energy loads required for PCC operation,the liquid,File:Coal fired power plant diagramsvg Wikimedia CommonsFeb 02,2013&#0183;&#32;File:Coal fired power plant diagramsvg Size of this PNG preview of this SVG file: 751 × 466 pixels Other resolutions: 320 × 199 pixels 640 × 397 pixels 1,024 × 635 pixels 1,280 × 794 pixels 2,560 × 1,588 pixels
