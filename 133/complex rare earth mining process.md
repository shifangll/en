Abstract.This chapter describes fused salt electrowinning of rare earth metals.The process entails (i) dissolving a rare earth compound (e.g.Nd 2 O 3) in 1050 &#176;C molten halide electrolyte,(ii) passing direct electric current through the electrolyte from a graphite anode to a tungsten cathode,and (iii) electrodepositing molten rare earth metal (e.g.neodymium) on the tungsten cathode.Rare Earth Minerals Kentucky River PropertiesRare Earth Minerals.New Opportunities in Rare Earth Element Recovery from Coal and Coal By Products Kentucky River Properties,LLC (KRP) is working in conjunction with Dr.Rick Honaker of the University of Kentucky Mining Engineering Department to commercially develop rare earth elements (REE) from Eastern Kentucky coal resources.
