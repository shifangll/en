Washing.Prior to leaching,the ore may be washed with water,alkali or acid to reduce cyanide consumption and increase gold recovery.For example,the free acid and soluble salts can be washed away with water; the acid can be neutralized with base; the copper oxides and carbonates can be eliminated with dilute sulfuric acid.The selective leaching of copper from a gold copper.4&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;fore gold in an alkaline glycine solution followed by washing and gold leaching either using the same process at elevated temperature (40 60 &#176;C),as patented by the authors,or using a cyanidation process.Copper selective leaching will reduce the gold losses due to a cementa tion mechanism of gold in the presence of metallic copper as all.

## Report on Leaching Washing and Solvent Extraction …
The leaching section is comprised of the Current Pre Leach Thickener (CPLT),Reclaim Pre Leach Thickener (RPLT),Kamana Water Reticulation Pump Station,Pre Leach Agitators and Leach Pachucas.The main purpose of this section is to dissolve out the acid soluble copper present in the feed (Tailings) by using concentrated sulphuric acid.extraction processes of copperExtraction of Copper.Copper is sometimes found as native metal.Copper ores include copperII oxide and copperII sulfide.CopperII oxide can be reduced by reaction with carbon.Some copper ores may contain only small amounts of copper.These are called low grade ores and have less than 1% copper but they are still used because copper is so.
