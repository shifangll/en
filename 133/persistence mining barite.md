• Significant potential environmental risks are associated with extreme natural events and failures in management practices.Extreme natural events (e.g.hurricanes,earthquakes,intense rainfall events,drought) have the potential to lead to the release of contaminants if facilities are not designed and constructed to withstand such events,or fail to perform as designed.The A.E.Seaman Mineral MuseumIn my wisdom,at the time,I decided not to go on to Michigan Tech,opting instead,to get out into the working world.I cannot complain how things turned out for me in my mining career since I’ve had a wonderful and varied career in mining and explosives.I can’t help but wonder what might have changed,however,if I had attended MTU.
