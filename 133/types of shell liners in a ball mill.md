## Mill Charge
Overcharging results in poor grinding and losses due to abrasion of rods and liners.Undercharging also promotes more abrasion of the rods.The height (or depth) of charge is measured in the same manner as for ball mill.The size of feed particles to a rod mill is coarser than for a ball mill.The usual feed size ranges from 6 to 25 mm.Ball millA ball mill is a type of grinder used to grind,blend and sometimes for mixing of materials for use in mineral dressing processes,paints,pyrotechnics,ceramics and selective laser sintering.It works on the principle of impact and attrition: size reduction is done by impact as the balls drop from near the top of the shell.A ball mill consists of a hollow c
