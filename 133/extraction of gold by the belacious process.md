## Summary of Gold Extraction Process
Gold extraction process is a combined process of various gold extraction methods (amalgamation,gravity separation,flotation,cyanidation) to extract gold from gold bearing rocks.The selection of the gold extraction process is mainly based on the nature …Gold cyanidationGold cyanidation (also known as the cyanide process or the MacArthur Forrest process) is a hydrometallurgical technique for extracting gold from low grade ore by converting the gold to a water soluble coordination complex.It is the most commonly used leaching process for gold extraction.

## Gold Extraction an overview ScienceDirect Topics
Gold and antimony are associated in a number of gold ores with resulting complications in the gold extraction process.The principal mineralogical forms in which gold occurs in these ores are: • Metallic gold,free milling or •Gold processingGold processing Gold processing Refining: Gold extracted by amalgamation or cyanidation contains a variety of impurities,including zinc,copper,silver,and iron.Two methods are commonly employed for purification: the Miller process and the Wohlwill process.The Miller process is based on the fact that virtually all the impurities present in gold combine with gaseous chlorine more.

## Gold extraction
Gold can be extracted by washing only when it is present as metal in the form of particles which are not too minute.The washing removes the specifically lighter parts of the material,the heavier gold particles sinking to the bottom.The process is applicable directly.How do we extract minerals?25&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;The primary methods used to extract minerals from the ground are: Underground miningSurface (open pit) miningPlacer mining The location and shape of the deposit,strength of the rock,ore grade,mining costs,and current market price of the commodity are some of the determining factors for selecting which mining method to use.
