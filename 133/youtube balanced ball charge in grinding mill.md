## Mill Steel Charge Volume Calculation
We can calculate the steel charge volume of a ball or rod mill and express it as the % of the volume within the liners that is filled with grinding media While the mill is stopped,the charge volume can be gotten by measuring the diameter inside the liners and the distance from the top of the charge to the top of the millThe effect of grinding media on the breakage rate in a.A vibration ball mill has enhanced impactiontogether with strong shear or abrasive stress.So the comminution performance of a vibration ball mill must be between the tumbling ball mill and the stirred ball mill,while the grinding mechanism in a planetary ball mill is hardly known.
