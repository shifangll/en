## Mineral dressing (= Orebeneficiation)
2009 5 16&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Mineral dressing (= Orebeneficiation) The first process most ores undergo after they leave the mine is mineral dressing (processing),also called ore preparation,milling,and ore dressing or ore beneficiation.Ore dressing is a process of mechanically separating the grains of ore minerals from the gangue minerals,to produce a concentrate.Pure Tungsten: 201327&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;This is why ore dressing plants are always located near the mine (to save transportation costs).Companies which process their own concentrates produce low grade concentrates ( 40% WO 3 ) in order to minimize the loss of tungsten minerals which increases with increasing concentration grade.
