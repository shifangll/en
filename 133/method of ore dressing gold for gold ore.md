## gold Taking Ore from the Earth
gold Taking Ore from the Earth Surface or near surface deposits—whether they are placers or veins—are the least difficult to mine.All that is required is to scoop up the ore,extract the gold,and discard the worthless material,or gangue.The open pit method may be employed,as at Carlin,Nevada.Where placers occur near water,all operations may be carried out within one huge.Mineral dressing (= Orebeneficiation)Mineral dressing (= Orebeneficiation) The first process most ores undergo after they leave the mine is mineral dressing (processing),also called ore preparation,milling,and ore dressing or ore beneficiation.Ore dressing is a process of mechanically separating the grains of ore minerals from the gangue minerals,to produce a concentrate.
