## SUITABILITY OF BLAST FURNACE SLAG IN CONCRETE
If the molten slag is cooled and solidified by rapid water quenching to a glassy state,little or no crystallization occurs.This process results in the formation of sand size (or frit like) fragments,usually with some friable clinkerlike material.The physical structure and gradation of granulatedBlast Furnace SlagIf the molten slag is cooled and solidified with water and air quenched in a spinning drum,pellets,rather than a solid mass,can be produced.and approximately 90 percent of this slag is ACBFS.The proportion of ACBFS currently being produced,however,is decreasing relative to granulated and pelletized blast furnace slag production.

## NATIONAL SLAG ASSOCIATION
Granulated slag is a glassy,granular product resulting from rapid quenching of the molten slag.Quenching with water is the most common process,but air or combinations of air and water may be used.Dependent upon the slag composition and temperature and the speed of quenching,the granulated slag may vary from a friable,popcorn likeMineral Resource of the Month: Iron and Steel Slag EARTH.Iron and steel slag,also known as ferrous slag,is produced by adding limestone (or dolomite),lime and silica sand to blast furnaces and steel furnaces to strip impurities from iron ore,scrap and other ferrous feed materials and to lower the heat requirements of the iron and steelmaking processes.Ferrous slag forms as a dominantly calcium silicate melt that floats on top of the molten.

Wrought iron is a very different material made by mixing liquid iron with some slag (leftover waste).The result is an iron alloy with a much lower carbon content.Wrought iron is softer than cast iron and much less tough,so you can heat it up to shape it relatively easily,and it's also much less prone to rusting.MUCH ADO ABOUT GGBSExpanded slag It is produced by treating the molten slag with controlled quantities of water,usually less than that used for granulation.The product is more vesicular and lighter in weight.
