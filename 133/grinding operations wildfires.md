## The Optimum Slash Pile Size for Grinding Operations.
Modeling of the excavator and grinder operations was also examined,and the constructed simulation model was observed to well replicate the actual operations.Based on the modeling,the productivity of grinding at a landing area of 710 m2 of slash pile location was estimated to be 31.24 BDT PMH0,which was the most productive rate.What Are the PMs?26&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;They are about 30 times smaller than the width of a human hair and are small enough to evade our defensive nose hairs and get inhaled into our lungs.Sources of this PM 10 include crushing grinding operations,and dust stirred up by vehicles.
