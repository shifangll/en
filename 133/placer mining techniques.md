## Placer mining : definition of Placer mining and …
Placer mining ( ˈ p l &#230; s ər or ˈ p l eɪ s ər ) [1] is the mining of alluvial deposits for minerals.This may be done by open pit (also called open cast mining) or by various surface excavating equipment or tunneling equipment.The name is sometimes said to derive from Spanish placer,meaning &quot;to please,&quot; (pleasure) because it is easy mining as compared with others.An Introduction to Placer Gold MiningThe most basic kind of gold placer mining is the using a prospector’s pan to swirl sediment filled water so that unwanted sediment spills out to leave bits of gold behind.This method is based on the fact that gold is heavier than typical sediment.This concept is the foundation for all placer mining techniques.

## Placer Mining,Gold Mining,Mineral Mining,Mining.
Placer mining is the mining of alluvial sediments for minerals.This may be through by open pit (also known as open cast mining) or by a variety of forms of tunneling into antique riverbeds.Excavation might be achieved using water pressure (hydraulic mining),layer digging out equipment or tunneling equipment.What is Placer Gold Mining?Unlike hardrock mining,which extracts veins of precious minerals from solid rock,placer mining is the practice of separating heavily eroded minerals like gold from sand or gravel.The word placer is thought to have come from Catalan and Spanish,meaning a shoal or sand bar.
