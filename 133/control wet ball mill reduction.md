## Ball mill Wikipedia
A ball mill is a type of grinder used to grind,blend and sometimes for mixing of materials for use in mineral dressing processes,paints,pyrotechnics,ceramics and selective laser sintering.It works on the principle of impact and attrition: size reduction is done by impact as the balls drop from near the top of the shell.A ball mill consists of a hollow cylindrical shell rotatiSWECOVibratory Grinding Mills Size Reduction Equipment Specifically designed for wet or dry grinding,the high amplitude Vibro Energy Grinding Mills range from 1 ft&#179; (36 liters) to 75 ft&#179; (1,934 liters) of volume.Wet or Dry Grinding Mill Models: DM1,DM4,DM10,DM20,DM28,DM70

## Combination of Solvent Displacement and Wet Ball Milling.
Background: The objective of the present study was to investigate the combinative effect of ball milling and solvent displacement method on size reduction of Celecoxib particles.Celecoxib is a poorly water soluble cyclooxygenase 2 inhibitor which has a wide range of therapeutic applicability.Methods: Microparticles were developed via solvent displacement method followed by planetary ball.Patterson Industries Ball & Pebble MillsPATTERSON Batch type Ball & Pebble Mills.PATTERSON's Ball and Pebble Mills are ideally suited for wet or dry grinding processes,size reduction and dispersion,and deflocculation in solid liquid systems.Mill sizes range from 10 gal.

## Ball Mill
The ball mill is a tumbling mill that uses steel balls as the grinding media.The length of the cylindrical shell is usually 1 1.5 times the shell diameter (Figure 8.11).The feed can be dry,with less than 3% moisture to minimize ball coating,or slurry containing 20 40% water by weight.Grinding Mills SWECOThe low energy condition is reserved for wet milling whereas the higher energy mode can be used either wet or dry.High Amplitude Wet or Dry Mills Vibratory Grinding Mills Size Reduction Equipment Specifically designed for wet or dry grinding,the high amplitude Vibro Energy Grinding Mills range from 1 ft³ (36 liters) to 75 ft³ (1,934 liters.
