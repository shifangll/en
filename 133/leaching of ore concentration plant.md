## The process design of gold leaching and carbon in pulp.
27&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Assuming that a gold ore has been effectively ground to ensure maximum economic liberation of gold,the circuits that will have the most effect on the successful operation of a gold plant will be that of the leaching and carbon in pulp circuit (CIP).The reagent and utilities operating costs associated with leaching,adsorption,elution and.Gold Leaching of Pyrite Concentrate2020 2 24&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Gold Leaching of Pyrite Concentrate.The ore consisted of quartz,in which,above the 250 ft.level,the iron minerals were largely oxidized and some free gold was visible; below that level few traces of oxidation occurred,and pyrite constituted the principal mineralizer in the quartz,together with occasional pockets of galena and a few.

## Flotation or Heap Leaching?
Leaching of whole ore at coarser sizes might yield better results at low costs.However these should be tested in lab and pilot plant scales before industrial application.Oxided Copper Ore Leaching9&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Leaching.The process requires the use of hydrochloric acid as leaching solution when treating copper ores,which may be produced in the plant itself.The operation is very simple,using sulphuric acid and NaCl as raw materials.
