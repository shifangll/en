## What is Mineral Processing? (with pictures)
2020416&ensp&#0183&enspThe final procedure in mineral processing is often dewatering,which separates moisture from the minerals.This may be achieved by passing the minerals over specialized screens,or through other methods.Particular minerals,such as metals,may undergo additional processing methods.Dewatering: An Increasingly Important Mineral …2019 11 8&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Filtration and thickening are areas of mineral recovery technology that are often overlooked.Nonetheless,they represent an important component of the entire process,since without dewatering,it would be hard to produce concentrates to transport specifications while water recycling from tailings streams is becoming increasingly important as energy costs for pumping steadily increase.

## Dewatering McLanahan
Dewatering through filtration separates liquids from solids by introducing a medium through which only the liquid can pass.Water and other liquids are removed from the slurry,draining out through a permeable barrier or filter media,and leave a trapped cake of drier solids that are too large to pass through the barrier or filter media.Minerals Special Issue : Dewatering of Fine Mineral …Effective dewatering methods with high sedimentation rates,good supernatant clarity and compact consolidation are required to address this issue.However,the conventional dewatering methods are often inefficient and or unable to achieve acceptable sediment consolidation,especially for tailings rich in fine mineral particles,even after.
