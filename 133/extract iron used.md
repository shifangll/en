## How is iron extracted from a blast furnace? AnswersDrive
Pure iron is too soft for many uses.Iron from the blast furnace is an alloy of about 96 percent iron,with carbon and some other impurities.It is hard,but too brittle for most uses,so most iron from the blast furnace is converted into steel by removing some of the carbon.How Is Iron Extracted From the Earth? Reference.comIron ores in the form of hematite (ferrous oxide) and magnetite are removed from the earth through mining.The use of heavy mining equipment is necessary to dig out large pits in an area with a large deposit of iron ore; however,because iron does not occur naturally,it is necessary to use a blast furnace to separate or refine iron from the other substances in the iron ore.
