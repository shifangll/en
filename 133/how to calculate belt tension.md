## V Belt and Flat Belt Design and Engineering Formulas.
The belt also tends to wedge into the groove as the load increases—the greater the load,the greater the wedging action—improving torque transmission and making the V belt an effective solution,needing less width and tension than flat belts.How to Measure V Belt Tension It Still RunsChecking the tension of all your V belts is important.Too much tension,and the belt will stretch and start to tear.Not enough tension causes the belt to slip and the pulleys scratch away at the belt.For each device,be it a car or washing machine,there is a specific amount of pressure the belt …
