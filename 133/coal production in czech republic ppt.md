Strikingly,the effects of coal pollution were not exclusively borne by the countries most responsible for polluting.For example,coal pollution in Poland caused 5800 premature deaths in the region,of which only 1100 occurred in Poland itself; more people in Slovakia,Hungary,and the Czech Republic died from Polish coal emissions than from their domestic coal industries.Analysis: In India's energy mix,gas faces tough battle.India imported 235.24 million mt of coal over the same period,up 13% from the year before.&quot;Coal consumption will still increase till 2040 because even if the share in energy mix is decreasing,the total coal based generation is increasing,&quot; Bhargava said.
