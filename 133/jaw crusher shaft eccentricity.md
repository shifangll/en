## Jaw Crusher Working Principle
On the overhead eccentric style Jaw Crusher,the moving swing jaw is suspended on the eccentric shaft with heavy duty double roll spherical roller bearings.The swing jaw undergoes two types of motion: one is a swing motion toward the opposite chamber side (called a stationary jaw die due to the action oCrushersThe first shaft is a pivoting shaft on the top of the crusher,while the other is an eccentric shaft that drives both toggle plates.The moving jaw has a pure reciprocating motion toward the fixed jaw.The crushing force is doubled compared to single toggle crushers and it can crush very hard ores.The jaw crusher is reliable and robust and.

## Performance optimization of jaw
One of the existing challenges associated with the operation of jaw type crushers is frequent failure of the eccentric shaft due to intermittent and cyclic shock loadsCrushersIn the single toggle jaw crusher,an eccentric shaft is on the top of the crusher.Shaft rotation causes,along with the toggle plate,a compressive action.A double toggle crusher has two shafts and two toggle plates.The first shaft is a pivoting shaft on the top of the crusher,while the other is an eccentric shaft that drives both toggle.
