## What is Silica Sand?
Construction: Industrial sand is the primary structural component in a wide variety of building and construction products.Whole grain silica is put to use in flooring compounds,mortars,specialty cements,stucco,roofing shingles,skid resistant surfaces,and asphalt mixtures to provide packing density and flexural strength without adversely affecting the chemical properties of the binding.Difference Between Silicon and Silica Definition. · Silicon and silica are two terms often used in inorganic chemistry.Silicon is the second most abundant element on the earth,second only to oxygen.Thus,it is very important to know the difference between silicon and silica.The main difference between silicon and silica is that silicon is an element whereas silica is a compound.Key Areas.
