Yes you can.Steel Ball Run takes place in another universe separate from the one Jonathan Joestar and his line resided in.It’s a sort of reboot reset for the series,so it’s probably the best place to start if a new reader doesn’t want to go thr.Johnny Joestar MUGEN Database Fandom2019 10 10&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Johnny Joestar is the main protagonist of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Steel Ball Run,as well as a minor character in JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: JoJolion.He is the alternate universe counterpart of Jonathan Joestar.Johnny is a former horse racing prodigy turned crippled and unable to use his legs after a youth shot him in the spine while waiting in line for a play.
