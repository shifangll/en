## Cement,How It Is Produced Mine Engineer.Com
Cement plants are typically located central to the minerals required to make the cement,which saves the transportation costs and reduces the price of the cement.Once the ore material to be used for cement has been mined,it is transported to the crushing screening plant,where it is crushed and screened,to produce the desired particle size.Cement Analysis and Production Information Thermo …Generally these additives are sand and iron ore,but other types of raw materials are used as well,such as marl,shale and fly ash.Cement composition will vary from plant to plant depending on the quality of the limestone in that specific quarry and the availability of additives in that area.
