## Environmental Risks of Mining
11&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Underground mining has the potential for tunnel collapses and land subsidence (Betournay,2011).It involves large scale movements of waste rock and vegetation,similar to open pit mining.Additionally,like most traditional forms of mining,underground mining can release toxic compounds into the air and water.MiningOpen pit mining Pit geometry.Deposits mined by open pit techniques are generally divided into horizontal layers called benches.The thickness (that is,the height) of the benches depends on the type of deposit,the mineral being mined,and the equipment being used; for large mines it is on the order of 12 to 15 metres (about 40 to 50 feet).
