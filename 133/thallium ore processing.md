Thallium in Ag Au ore concentrates,M4 and M36,was mostly found in the residual fraction (78 and 55%),followed by the oxidizable (16 and 13%) and crystalline reducible fractions (3 and 22%,respectively) (Table 4,Fig.3).However,little amounts of Tl were found in both exchangeable (1.7 2.3%) and poorly crystalline reducible (1.8 7.3%.ThalliumThallium is a chemical element with symbol Tl and atomic number 81.This soft gray post transition metal is not found free in nature.When isolated,thallium resembles tin,but discolors when exposed to air.Chemists William Crookes and Claude Auguste Lamy discovered thallium independently in 1861,in residues of sulfuric acid production.Both used the newly developed method of flame.
