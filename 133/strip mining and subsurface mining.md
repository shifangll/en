## What Is Surface Mining? Convergence Training
Strip mining is the process of removing a thin strip of overburden (earth or soil) above a desired deposit,dumping the removed overburden behind the deposit,extracting the desired deposit,creating a second,parallel strip in the same manner,and depositing the waste materials from that second (new) strip onto the first strip.Underground v.s.Surface Coal Mines: Is Deep Drilling.2020 2 26&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Strip mining is sensible when the ore body is near the surface.The practice includes some of the largest machines on earth,removing long strips of overlying soil and rock and then removing coal deposits.Open pit mining utilizes blasting and mineral removing,digger deeper into the earth causing a crater like result.

Surface mining is a form of mining in which the soil and the rock covering the mineral deposits are removed.It is the other way of underground mining,in which the overlying rock is left behind,and the required mineral deposits are removed through shafts or tunnels.Surface mining is basically employed when deposits of commercially viable minerals or rock are found closer to the surface.Strip MiningSurface mining of coal is an alternative to underground mining,and it is practiced as strip mining,the most common form,and auger mining.Some coal is also produced through dredging and culm bank (i.e.anthracite waste piles) recovery,but these quantities tend to be relatively small compared to underground,strip,and auger mining.
