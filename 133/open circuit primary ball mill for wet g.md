## Thalanga Zinc Project,Queensland
2020 2 14&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;The Thalanga zinc project is located 60km south west of the city of Charters Towers in Queensland,Australia.The mine is estimated to produce 21,400t of zinc,3,600t of copper,5,000t of lead,2,000oz of gold and 370,000oz of silver a year during the initial life of mine (LoM),which is estimated.Rod MillRod mills are used in an open circuit between crushing and the ball mill.They often operate in wet and where the pulp contains up to 50% solid by mass.This machine is equally very applicable to dry where it could take a feed that has achieved 6% moisture.As such,when the product is sticky,rod mills are preferred over ball mills.
