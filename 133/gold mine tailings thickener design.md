## Mine Tailings
Hazardous Properties.Toxic chemicals used to extract the valuable materials from the ore,such as the cyanide used in gold mining,remain in the tailings at the end of the process,and may leach out into ground water.Rock may naturally contain dangerous chemicals,such as arsenic and mercury,which leach into water much more readily after rock has been ground up and exposed to the wind and.Pogo thickener testing Australian MiningOutotec and Teck Cominco have conducted test work to determine the best thickening solution for flotation tailings,flotation concentrate,and post CN destruction CIP tailings stages at Pogo mine
