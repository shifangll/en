## Poem: The Water Mill by Sarah Doudney
Listen to the water mill,Through the livelong day; How the clicking of the wheel Wears the hours away.Languidly the autumn wind Stirs the withered leaves; On the field the reapers sing,Binding up the sheaves; And a proverb haunts my mind,And as a spell is cast,&quot; The mill will never grind With the water that has passed.&quot; Autumn winds revive no more Leaves strewn o'erwatermillwater mill n noun: Refers to person,place,thing,quality,etc.(mill driven by water) molino de agua grupo nom grupo nominal : Expresi&#243;n que combina un sustantivo con sus modificadores y complementos,que forman una expresi&#243;n compuesta usual,sin llegar a ser una locuci&#243;n nominal fija (&quot;adjudicaci&#243;n de herencia&quot;,&quot;despedida de soltero&quot;).

## Watermill
Typically,water is diverted from a river or impoundment or mill pond to a turbine or water wheel,along a channel or pipe (variously known as a flume,head race,mill race,leat,leet,lade (Scots) or penstock).The force of the water's movement drives the blades of a wheel or turbine,which in turn rotates an axle that drives the mill's other machinery.
