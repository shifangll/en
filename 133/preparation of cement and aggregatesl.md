Handy guide on factors to multiply per cubic on different concrete class mixtures.Just multiply each factor to the total volume (in cubic meter) and youâ€™ll get the needed amount of cement (40Kg bag),sand (cu.m.) and gravel (cu.m.).Raw materialsRaw materials are extracted from the quarry,then crushed and ground as necessary to provide a fine material for blending.Most of the material is usually ground finer than 90 microns the fineness is often expressed in terms of the percentage retained on a 90 micron sieve.

## preparation of cement and aggregates
Concrete mix design is the process of finding the proportions of concrete mix in terms of ratios of cement,sand and coarse aggregates.For e.g.a concrete mix of proportions 1:2:4 means that cement,fine and coarse aggregate are in the ratio 1:2:4 or the mix contains one part of cement,two parts of fine aggregate and four parts of coarse aggregate.Construction Of One Three Vent And Four Two Vent H â€¦IAWD Construction Of One Three Vent And Four Two Vent Hume Pipe Sluice Structure Along With Sump For Temporary Pump Over Periphera,Due Date: 2019,Tender Value: 25242541,Location: West Bengal Tender Not89
