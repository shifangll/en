## Gearless mill drives
Our GMD eliminates all mechanical components of a conventional mill drive system,such as ring gear,pinion,gearbox,coupling,motor shaft and motor bearings: By mounting the rotor poles directly onto the mill,the mill itself becomes the rotor of the gearless motor.4x100ml Gear Drive 0.4L Planetary Ball MillPQ N04 series planetary ball mills may be used for mixing,homogenizing,fine grinding,mechanical alloying,cell disruption,small volume high tech material production and even colloidal grinding.They are the ideal wet dry milling tools for acquiring research samples with high efficiency and low noise.Vacuum jars may be used to process sample within a vacuum environment.

## Mill Speed
Mill Speed Critical Speed.Mill Speed.No matter how large or small a mill,ball mill,ceramic lined mill,pebble mill,jar mill or laboratory jar rolling mill,its rotational speed is important to proper and efficient mill operation.Too low a speed and little energy is imparted on the product.Too fast and inefficient media movement (known.Planetary Ball Mill PM 100Planetary Ball Mills are used wherever the highest degree of fineness is required.In addition to well proven mixing and size reduction processes,these mills also meet all technical requirements for colloidal grinding and provide the energy input necessary for mechanical alloying.The extremely high centrifugal forces of a planetary ball mill result in very high pulverization energy and.
