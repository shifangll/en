## Properties of Concrete with Bagasse Ash as Fine …
Grate ash shows poor chemical reactivity with portland cement,making it not very effective as a pozzolan.It can,however,be used as a fine aggregate constituent of concrete.Five grades of concrete were tested,ranging from 20 to 60 MPa,to compare the performance of grate ash concrete with that of normal concrete.AggregatesFine aggregates generally consist of natural sand or crushed stone with most particles passing through a 3 inch sieve.Gravels constitute the majority of coarse aggregate used in concrete with crushed stone making up most of the remainder.Natural gravel and sand are usually dug or dredged from a pit,river,lake,or seabed.Crushed.
