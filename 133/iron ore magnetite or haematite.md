## Razorback Iron Project Magnetite Mines
Iron ore from Razorback Ridge can produce a concentrate of 68.8% Fe.ASX Media Release 16 09 2016.When compared to haematite DSO,magnetite concentrates contain much lower levels of impurities,such as phosphorous,sulphur and aluminium.Iron ore concentrates derived from magnetite are a premium product and attract higher prices from steelmakers.Hematite: A primary ore of iron and a pigment mineralWhat is Hematite? Hematite is one of the most abundant minerals on Earth's surface and in the shallow crust.It is an iron oxide with a chemical composition of Fe 2 O 3.It is a common rock forming mineral found in sedimentary,metamorphic,and igneous rocks at locations throughout the world.Hematite is the most important ore of iron.Although it was once mined at thousands of locations around.
