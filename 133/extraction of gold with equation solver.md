## The Silver Extraction Process
2018 1 17&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;The Silver Extraction Process.The ore used to extract silver was not a silver ore but Lead Sulphide (formula PbS),known as Galena or Galenite (named by the Roman Pliny) which contains 87% lead.The local variety of Galenite is silver bearing and is known as Argentiferous Galenite (formula (Pb.Ag)S ) and the lead obtained from this ore.12.7 Logarithmic equationsExample: Solve the logarithmic equation log (3 x + 1) − 2 log (x) = 1 for x: Solution: The first step is to combine the logarithms using the properties of logarithms.First use property 3,then property 2: log(3 x + 1) − log (x 2 ) = 1 The next step is to antilog both sides.Note that the base of the logarithm is understood to be 10.The equation is no longer logarithmic it is fractional.
