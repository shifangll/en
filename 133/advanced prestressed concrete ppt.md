## Prestressed Concrete Structure
Prestressed concrete structures may suffer from damage of steel strands,including insufficient load carrying capacity and degraded serviceability (e.g.large deflection and excessive cracks).Corrosion of steel strands may be the most significant contribution to the initiation and acceleration of damage in prestressed concrete members.Lecture Notes Mechanics and Design of Concrete.4&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Don't show me this again.Welcome!
