## Frequently Asked Questions The Jet Pulverizer Company
Ball mills can be lined with ceramics to reduce contamination from abrasive products but there is constant wear of the media,which may contaminate the product.Ball mills are often used in high volume,mine mouth operations where cost ton has precedence over size distribution.What particle size range does a jet mill produce?PM GrindControlPressure and temperature measuring system In order to understand the processes which occur during grinding with ball mills (e.g.chemical reactions,phase changes),it is helpful to record the most important thermodynamic parameters: pressure and temperature.Planetary ball mills are frequently used for the development of new materials by mechanical alloying due to their high energy input.
