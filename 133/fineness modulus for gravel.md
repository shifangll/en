6&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;What Is Fineness Modulus of Sand? Fineness modulus of sand (fine aggregate) is an index number which represents the mean size of the particles in sand.It is calculated by performing sieve analysis with standard sieves.The cumulative percentage retained on each sieve is added and subtracted by 100 gives the value of fineness modulus.Fineness Modulus Scientific.NetAbstract: Based on a series tests,the properties of proto machine made sand of gravel such as grain feature,fineness modulus,grading,density,void ratio and MB value as well as the fineness distribution of stone powder were studied,the influences of content of stone powder on these properties of sand and strength of cement mortar were investigated.

## THE ROLE OF FINENESS MODULUS
Fineness modulus also provides important information about the density of the resulting concrete,as well as its compressive strength.Both of these factors must be taken into consideration when designing the concrete.For more information about the role played by fineness modulus,contact the concrete experts at Southport Concrete Corp.cnkiA Fineness Modulus of up to 3.8 can provide excellent results for pavement.In fact,sand that meets ASTM C 's lower gradation limit will have a Fineness Modulus of 3.45.Ordinary portland cement,natural river sand of fineness modulus of 2.78 and natural gravel of maximum size 10 mm as coarse aggregate were used.
