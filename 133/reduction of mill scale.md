## Study of Kinetics of Mill Scale Reduction: For PM.
Mill scale is a very attractive industrial waste due to its promising scope in many applications.Recovery of iron powder from iron oxide in mill scale could be considered as a method of beneficiation.The reduction of ground and powdered mill scale from rolling mill was studied using hydrogen gas …Technical Report Deformation Behavior of Oxide Scale in.2016 4 6&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;thickness at the entry to the No.2 Mill was roughly 12 μm,and the reduction of the mill was set at 35%.At 1 000&#176;C,the scale thickness was substantially even and there were no cracks.Cracks in the thickness direction increased as the rolling temperature lowered; in particular,at 600&#176;C or lower,cracks across the whole scale thick
