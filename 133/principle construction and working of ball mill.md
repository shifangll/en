## Working and Principle of colloidal Mill Pharma Pathway
Working of the Colloidal Mill.The material is placed into the mill though the inlet hopper.It is then passed through the narrow gap between the rotor and stator and thus reduced the fine particle size.A colloid mill is a hydraulic shear producing device.The colloid mill works to reduce the size of the suspended droplets.ball mill working principle Henan Deya Machinery …Ball Mill Working Principle Grinding is usually performed wet,although in certain applications dry grinding is used.When the mill is rotated,the mixture of medium,ore,and water,known as the mill charge,is intimately mixed; the medium comminuting the particles depends on the speed of rotation of the mill and the shell liner structure.
