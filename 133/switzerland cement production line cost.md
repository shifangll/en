## Cement Tracking Industry Analysis
The feasibility study,completed in early 2019,showed that electrified cement production is technically possible and likely cost competitive with other options to substantially reduce emissions.The next step will be an in depth study on how to construct a pilot plant.Energy optimization in cement manufacturing9&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Energy optimization in cement manufacturing Reprint from ABB Review 2 2007 Cement producers are large consumers of thermal and electrical energy,which on a global level are only available at steadily increasing costs.Efforts to reduce demands by using higher efﬁ ciency equip ment and substituting fuels and raw materials to lower production
