 · Leaching gold with a cyanide solution remains the most widely used hydrometallurgical process for the extraction of gold from ores and concentrates.Despite the difficulties and hazards of working with cyanide,no other process has yet been proven to be an economic viable alternative.A paper published by L.Elsner in 1846 first correctly.Gold Processing Equipment,Process Flow,Cases13&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;The gold content in the placer gold mine is extremely low,and it is known as the gold panning by beneficiate the placer gold through various energy efficient placer gold equipment.Among various gold extraction methods,the gravity separator method is energy saving,efficient,environmentally friendly,and is suitable for placer gold ore process.
