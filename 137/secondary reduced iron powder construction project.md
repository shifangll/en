## Hysteresis Eddy Current Iron or Core Losses and Copper …
Hysteresis loss and eddy current loss,both depend upon magnetic properties of the materials used to construct the core of transformer and its design.So these losses in transformer are fixed and do not depend upon the load current.So core losses in transformer which is alternatively known as iron loss in transformer can be considered as constant for all range of load.Secondary (Rechargeable) Batteries Battery UniversityBU : Comparison Table of Secondary Batteries Select between maximum runtime,long service life,small size and low cost.Rechargeable batteries play an important role in our lives and many daily chores would be unthinkable without the ability to recharge.The.

## How iron is made
Background Iron is one of the most common elements on earth.Nearly every construction of man contains at least a little iron.It is also one of the oldest metals and was first fashioned into useful and ornamental objects at least 3,500 years ago.Iron Ore Processing for the Blast FurnaceIron Ore Processing for the Blast Furnace (Courtesy of the National Steel Pellet Company) The following describes operations at the National Steel Pellet Company,an iron ore mining and processing facility located on the Mesabi Iron Range of Minnesota.
