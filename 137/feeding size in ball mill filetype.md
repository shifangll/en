## Calculate and Select Ball Mill Ball Size for Optimum Grinding
In Grinding,selecting (calculate) the correct or optimum ball size that allows for the best and optimum ideal or target grind size to be achieved by your ball mill is an important thing for a Mineral Processing Engineer AKA Metallurgist to do.Often,the ball used in ball mills is oversize “just in case”.Well,this safety factor can cost you much in recovery and or mill liner wear and.Mill (grinding)W is the work index measured in a laboratory ball mill (kilowatt hours per metric or short ton) P 80 is the mill circuit product size in micrometers; F 80 is the mill circuit feed size in micrometers.Rod mill.A rotating drum causes friction and attrition between steel rods and ore particles.[citation needed] But note that the term 'rod mill.
