## Copper Mining and Processing: Processing of Copper Ores …
Copper processing is a complicated process that begins with mining of the ore (less than 1% copper) and ends with sheets of 99.99% pure copper called cathodes,which will ultimately be made into products for everyday use.The most common types of ore,copper oxide and copper sulfide,undergo two different processes,hydrometallurgy and pyrometallurgy,respectively,due to the different.Copper Production: How Is Copper Made?Copper processing is a complex process that involves many steps as the manufacturer processes the ore from its raw,mined state into a purified form for use in many industries.Copper is typically extracted from oxide and sulfide ores that contain between 0.5 and 2.0% copper.

## copper ore concentration processing
Copper oxides are more abundant near the surface,but are considered lowgrade ore,with a lower concentration of copper.Although this requires more ore to be extracted and processed,this process is less expensive,so oxides can still be mined at a profit.On the.Innovations: Introduction to Copper: Mining &amp; ExtractionCopper minerals and ores are found in both igneous and sedimentary rocks.Mining of copper ores is carried out using one of two methods.However,by far the greatest extension in the use of copper resulted from Michael Faraday's discovery of electromagnetic induction in 1831 and the way that the effect could be used to generate electricity.
