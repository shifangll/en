## A novel approach of evaluating crushing energy in ball.
Ball mill is a kind of widely used engineering machinery with low working efficiency [1,2].Since the advent of the ball mill,researches on its grinding performance mainly aimed at the aspects of fill rate,rotational speed,ratio of steel balls,ratio of grinding mediDry grinding in planetary ball mills: Evaluation of a.Planetary ball mills at laboratory scale are widely used for grinding and alloying processes.However,in contrast to other mill types,no applicable mechanistic model exists to describe the stressing conditions and their effect on particle breakage,so that processes are empirically evaluated so far.
