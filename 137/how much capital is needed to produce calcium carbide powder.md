## Percent Yield
Percent yield is the amount of a product made in the chemical reaction measured by dividing the amount of product by the amount of theoretical yield which could be created.Percent yield represents the ratio between what is experimentally obtained and what is theoretically calculated,multiplied by 100%.Study 73 Terms CHEM 1100 STUDY.Flashcards QuizletAt the higher temperature fewer molecules are needed to produce the pressure because their average velocity is higher.The sample at 800 torr has more molecules,which is why the pressure is higher.Before the development of reliable batteries,miners' lamps burned acetylene produced by the reaction of calcium carbide with water.
