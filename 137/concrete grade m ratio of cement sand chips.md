## Concrete Mix Design M 20 Grade Of Concrete
Note: 1 The above recommended mix design must be verified,by actual cube tests.2 The mix design is based on the quality and grading of the materials actually supplied,by the client.Any variation in quality and gradation will result in changes in the mix design.concreteA ratio by weight of 0.5 water,1 cement,3 sand,and 3 gravel should make a fine concrete,although a little less water (0.4 by weight) would make stronger concrete.The same by volume ( ie.buckets) is a good ratio as well,1 2 to 1 to 3 to 3 (or a little less water too much water weakens the concrete,and there will always be some water content in the sand).
