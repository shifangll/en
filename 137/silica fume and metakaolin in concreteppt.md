## Metakaolin Concrete
Highly reactive metakaolin has become available as a considerably reactive pozzolanic material in concrete.This type of material is not like other admixtures for example fly ash,blast furnace slag,and silica fumes in terms of production because it is produced.The Mechanical Properties of the Concrete Using …Environmentally friendly and high performance concrete is very import for the applications in sewage and water treatment industry.Using mineral additives such as fly ash and silica fume has been proven to be an effective approach to improve concrete properties.This paper reports a study of the effect of using both polymer and metakaolin additives together on the mechanical and durability.
