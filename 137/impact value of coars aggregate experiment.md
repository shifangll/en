## Aggregate impact value Calculation And uses
Aggregate impact value Calculation And uses 1.Created by Shahryar &amp; CO.2.This test is done to determine the aggregate impact value of coarse aggregates AIV is basically a % ratio of 2.36mm sieved aggregate to 14mm aggregate sieve.What is the need of impact test?The aim of aggregate impact test is to determine the relative measure of the resistance of aggregate to sudden shock or impact in which in some aggregate differs from its resistance to a slowly applies compressive load.The property of a material.

## Aggregate Impact Value Test YouTube
Aug 27,2009&#0183;&#32;Impact value of an aggregate is the percentage loss of particles passing 236mm sieve by the application or load by means of 15 blows of standard hammer and drop,under specified test conditionDensity of AggregateDensity is an important parameter for aggregate.For aggregates,density is determined by multiplying the relative density (specific gravity) of the aggregate times the density of water.Bulk Density of Aggregate [1]The bulk density or unit weight of an aggregate is the mass or weight of the aggregate that required to fill a container of a specified unit volume.
