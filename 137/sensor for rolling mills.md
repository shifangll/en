## Hot Rolling Rolling Mills
Infrared sensors measure strip and sheet temperature so that rolling mill stands can be efficiently set to match the steel’s temperature.Sensors can be used to detect the presence of hot metal and accurately time the roll stand operation.Pyrometers can be used to measure the roll temperature as water cools the roll during the quenching process.Electrical and automation systems for rolling millsThe rolling applications covered by Ingeteam,are the following: Rolling mills with one or several stands (Cluster and Sendzimir mills),line and continuous tandem mills,reversible and non reversible reduction,skin pass (temper mill),double cold reduction (DCR) and rolling of sheet steel

## A roll eccentricity sensor for steel strip rolling mills
&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;Abstract: The problem of roll eccentricity compensation in steel strip rolling mills is examined.A novel roll eccentricity sensor is proposed for the task of retrieving the desired reference signal from the available roll force measurement.The sensor implements a modified comb filter structure.Aluminum Rolling MillsThese industries demand exacting tolerances and precise mechanical properties,particularly for new,technically challenging high strength alloys.As a result,modern aluminum rolling mills demand previously unobtainable levels of aluminum infrared temperature sensor accuracy for the control of rolling mill bite,pressure,speed,and coolant.
