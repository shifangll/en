## Copper
Copper does not react with water,but it does slowly react with atmospheric oxygen to form a layer of brown black copper oxide which,unlike the rust that forms on iron in moist air,protects the underlying metal from further corrosion (passivation).A green layer of verdigris (copper carbonate) can often be seen on old copper structures,such as the roofing of many older buildings and the.Types of Ore MiningHallOfFame.orgOre is rock that contains economic amounts of a particular element,e.g.gold ore,iron ore,molybdenum ore,or praseodimium ore.In contrast,rock that is not judged to contain economic quantities of an element is categorized as waste rock.The metals in ore can occur in many different minerals (compounds) in the rock.As an example,copper occurs in more than 50 minerals

The barren rock,or gangue has to be separated from the sulfide minerals in order to smelt the metallic copper from the ore.By far the greatest proportion of copper is extracted from the sulfides of copper,iron and sometimes other metals.Such ores originate from sulfur bearing volcanic magmas,which have separated into metal sulfides and siliceous melts.Ore CoreThe Ore Core is a forge mod that combines a lots of other mods and ideas from me to a compact and powerful core.(i only use the ideas of the mods,the code &amp; textures are from myself).NOTE: T his mod will not continue in Minecraft 1.13 and higher,for the newer …

## Ore Wikipedia
Ore is natural rock or sediment that contains one or more valuable minerals,typically metals,that can be mined,treated and sold at a profit.Ore is extracted from the earth through mining and treated or refined,often via smelting,to extract the valuable metals or minerals.The grade of ore refers to the concentration of the desired material it contains.Precious Metal Ores,Gold,Platinum,Silver and CopperBy ore mineral is meant a metalliferous mineral which owes its economic value to the fact that it is smelted or otherwise processed to obtain a useful metal.A large number of economic minerals however,require treatment to be concentrated (i.e.separated from the matrix) before the minerals are available for smelting or other processing to.

Impurities in Iron Ores.There are certain impurities that lower the value of iron ores or may even make them valueless.Sulphur in the ore goes partly into the iron and steel and makes them brittle.While it is possible by roasting the ore and by other means to remove the sulphur,the presence of any considerable amount is objectionable.Copper WikipediaCopper is a chemical element with the symbol Cu (from Latin: cuprum) and atomic number 29.It is a soft,malleable,and ductile metal with very high thermal and electrical conductivity.A freshly exposed surface of pure copper has a pinkish orange color.Copper is used as a conductor of heat and electricity,as a building material,and as a constituent of various metal alloys,such as sterling.
