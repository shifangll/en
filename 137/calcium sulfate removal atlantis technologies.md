## Chapter 07
For example,in cold lime treatment of a water containing 110 ppm of calcium,95 ppm of magnesium,and at least 110 ppm of alkalinity (all expressed as calcium carbonate),calcium could theoretically be reduced to 35 ppm and the magnesium to about 70 ppm.SulfatesIon exchange systems for removal of sulfate use a different type of resin,but they work in an analogous manner.Sulfate ions in the water switch places with other ions which are on the resin,usually chloride.When the resin is full with sulfate,it must be
