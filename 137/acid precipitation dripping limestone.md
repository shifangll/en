## How Does Weathering Affect Limestone? Reference.com
Water acts as an acid when it contacts calcium carbonate,dissolving the limestone.The dissolved calcium carbonate may drip into underground caves hollowed out from the action of weathering.Sometimes,the calcium carbonate evaporates as it drips from the cave ceiling creating stalactites.Limestone and Acid Rain University Of IllinoisLimestone and Acid Rain Carbon Dioxide Bicarbonate Carbonate Equilibrium One important buffer in surface waters is the carbon dioxide bicarbonate carbonate buffer

## Limestone: Rock Uses,Formation,Composition,Pictures
Composition of Limestone Limestone is by definition a rock that contains at least 50% calcium carbonate in the form of calcite by weight.All limestones contain at least a few percent other materials.These can be small particles of quartz,feldspar,clay minerals,pyrite,siderite,and other minerals.siderite,and other minerals.What Is The Difference Between Limestone &amp; Sandstone?Limestone is found in beds,and most limestone beds form in marine environments in which big deposits of organisms and carbonate precipitation build up over the years,like an ocean or large lake.Sandstone is shaped from the breakdown of larger rocks due to weathering and erosion as well as from processes that occur inside the rock,usually biologic but now and again chemical in nature.
