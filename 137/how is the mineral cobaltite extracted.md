## What Are the Uses of Cobalt? Sciencing
Cobalt,which has the element symbol Co,is a metal usually obtained through mining nickel,silver,lead,copper and iron.In 1739,Georg Brandt discovered it while studying minerals that gave glass a deep blue color.Today,cobalt's uses range from health and.Clay mineral&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;Chemical and physical properties Ion exchange Depending on deficiency in the positive or negative charge balance (locally or overall) of mineral structures,clay minerals are able to adsorb certain cations and anions and retain them around the outside of the structural unit in an exchangeable state,generally without affecting the basic silicate structure.

## How Is Cobalt Extracted?
Cobalt is then extracted in a variety of ways.Cobalt is extracted from the nickel or copper through solvent extraction,which is separating compounds based on their solubility in two immiscible liquids,such as an organic solvent and water.Hence,it extracts theCobaltCobalt is an essential trace element,and forms part of the active site of vitamin B12.The amount we need is very small,and the body contains only about 1 milligram.Cobalt salts can be given to certain animals in small doses to correct mineral deficiencies.In

## Cobalt (Co)
Cobalt is not found as a free metal and is generally found in the form of ores.Cobalt is usually not mined alone,and tends to be produced as a by product of nickel and copper mining activities.The main ores of cobalt are cobaltite,erythrite,glaucodot,andcobalt processing Uses,Supply,&amp; Facts Britannica&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;Cobalt processing,preparation of the metal for use in various products.Below 417 &#176;C (783 &#176;F),cobalt (Co) has a stable hexagonal close packed crystal structure.At higher temperatures up to the melting point of 1,495 &#176;C (2,723 &#176;F),the stable form is face centred cubic.The metal has 12.
