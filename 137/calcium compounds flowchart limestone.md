## Limestone: The Calcium Carbonate Chemical Sedimentary …
Calcium constitutes 3.64 percent of Earth’s crust and 8 percent of the Moon’s crust,and its cosmic abundance is estimated at 4.9 &#215; 10 4 atoms (on a scale where the abundance of silicon is 10 6 atoms).As calcite (calcium carbonate),it occurs on Earth in limestone,chalk,marble,dolomite,eggshells,pearls,coral,stalactites,stalagmites,and the shells of many marine animals.Calcium (Ca) and waterLimestone is applied as a paper filler,causing paper to colour whiter,and in plastics to improve stability.Calcium often positively affects soil quality and various compounds are applied as a fertilizer.For example,CaCl or Ca(NO) 3 solutions are applied in.
