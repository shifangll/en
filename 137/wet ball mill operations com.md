## Wet Ball Value or L.A.Abrasion Testing Alternatives.
&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;We have a client requesting a wet ball value (TXDOT TEST METHODS 116 E) or,as an alternative,an LA Abrasion Test.The problem is they don't have enough material to run either test.Are there any other tests out there that would yield similar information with a smaller sample size (6000 grams or less)? Thanks in advance for any help.Drum Mill Rod Mill TM 300 XLThe TM 300 Drum Mill is used for the preparation of granules and powders.The grinding process is performed either in dry or wet conditions.The drum mill can be operated either as a Ball or as a Rod Mill by using the corresponding module.A sufficient number of balls or rods is required for an effective grinding process.
