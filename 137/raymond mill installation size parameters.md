The same is true for Raymond Mill.If the particle size of the raw material to be milled is too large,it will not only increase the difficulty of milling,but also affect the efficiency of Raymond Mill if the particlVertical Roller Mill Play An Important Role In Cement IndustryVertical Roller Mill Play An Important Role In Cement Industry.Vertical roller mills create a particle size distribution with a sharper cut in comparison to cement milled in a traditional ball mill.That is,the particle size distribution is in a narrower band.
