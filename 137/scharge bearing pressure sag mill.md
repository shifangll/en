The best way to measure load is to mount the mill on load cells.The load cells are calibrated to measure the total weight of water,grinding media (balls) and ore in the mill,but not the weight of the mill itself.While many mills today are mounted on load cells,others employ beOPTIMAL SAG MILL CONTROL USING VIBRATION &amp; DIGITAL …Figure 4 Mill Conditions: Too Fast,Too Empty,Full Mill (left to right) After the polar plot is checked to determine if a mill is operating at too high an RPM,the fill levels are monitored.Figure 5 illustrates a trend taken from a

## Using Fuzzy Control to Optimize SAG Mill Production
In general,either sound or bearing pressure can be used because of the tendency for the sound to increase when the bearing pressure is decreasing.MILL DENSITY CONTROL RULES The feed water addition to Sag mills is also a very important control variable.TherModel Predictive Control for SAG Milling in Minerals.Model Predictive Control for SAG Milling in Minerals Processing 5 Model Predictive Control on a SAG Mill and Ball Mills The solution for the SAG Mill is an adaptive controller which controls mill load using direct mill weight measurement or indirectly from bearing oil pressure.
