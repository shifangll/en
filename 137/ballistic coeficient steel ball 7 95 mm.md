## Ballistic Coefficient: Everything You Ever Wanted to Know
Ballistic coefficient,and to an extent drag itself,is what is going to determine some of the most important factors in shooting.This includes the rounds trajectory,velocity,and wind drift.For example,if you like to shoot old cap and ball revolvers you are familiar with standard round balls as projectiles.Alexander ArmsAt 600 yards,tennis ball size targets are no match for this flat shooting round.For extreme accuracy,formidable terminal ballistics and long range applications,the 6.5 Grendel from Alexander Arms is unbeatable.Compared to the 5.56 NATO,the 6.5 Grendel

## Ballistic Coefficient
Ballistic Coefficient (BC) is basically a measure of how streamlined a bullet is; that is,how well it cuts through the air.Mathematically,it is the ratio of a bullet's sectional density to its coefficient of form.Ballistic Coefficient is essentially a measure of air drag.Ballistic CoefficientsHere,Hard Air Magazine is publishing the World’s first comprehensive,structured and independent database of airgun pellet Ballistic Coefficients.We hope that you find it useful!

Projectile diameter: 0.30 inches (7.7 mm) The cartridge consists of a heavy metal (tungsten) penetrator that is sabot launched at a much higher velocity than standard rounds.The sabot,which is designed to break up at the muzzle to release the penetrator,must also survive the gun environment until launch.
