## Heap Leaching
Heap leaching is an industrial mining process of separating precious metals,copper and other minerals from ores.It involves a series of chemical processes through which the mineral ores are piled in the form of a heap and a leach solution is spread over the ore surface to leach metal from the heap.Heap LeachingCopper Agitated Leaching and cementation process of copper problem: The treatment of copper ores,both oxides and sulfides by means of flotation,hydrometallurgy or other processes has been well established for many years.Flotation has been applied generally

## Heap Leaching Copper Ore
The objective of the leaching cycle is the recovery or extraction of a majority of the copper content in the first leaching period.The remaining copper will be re worked after a new lift of 18 to 20 feet of fresh ore is placed on top and leaching started again.Heap leachingHeap leaching is an industrial mining process used to extract precious metals,copper,uranium,and other compounds from ore using a series of chemical reactions that absorb specific minerals and re separate them after their division from other earth materials.
