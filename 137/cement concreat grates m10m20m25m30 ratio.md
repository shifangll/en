## Why Concrete Cracks The Concrete Network
Concrete slabs can shrink as much as 1 2 inch per 100 feet.This shrinkage causes forces in the concrete which literally pull the slab apart.Cracks are the end result of these forces.The bottom line is a low water to cement ratio is the number one issue effecting concrete quality and excess water reduces this ratio.Reinforcement For Slabs on Ground Concrete Construction â€¦There are many opinions floating around as to the benefits,or lack thereof,of reinforcement in slabs on ground.Not all reinforcement works the same way.To be able to understand the potential benefits and negatives of any particular reinforcement system,one has to understand how that system theoretically works and also what happens in the real world.
