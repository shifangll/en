## Savonius wind turbine
The Savonius turbine is one of the simplest turbines.Aerodynamically,it is a drag type device,consisting of two or three scoops.Looking down on the rotor from above,a two scoop machine would look like an &quot;S&quot; shape in cross section.Because of the curvature,the scoops experience less drag when moving against the wind than when moving with the wind.Vertical Windmill Mk2 by miiiike&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;If you print this Thing and display it in public proudly give attribution by printing and displaying this tag.Here's my 'Mk2' Vertical Axis Wind Turbine (VAWT).I've always liked the lines of these,but they really caught my attent

## Milling (machining)
Milling is the process of machining using rotary cutters to remove material by advancing a cutter into a workpiece.This may be done varying direction on one or several axes,cutter head speed,and pressure.Milling covers a wide variety of different operations and machines,on scales from small individual parts to large,heavy duty gang milling operations.Vertical MachiningThe VTC (Vertical Traveling Column Series) is a fixed table design vertical mill that offers both CAT40 and CAT50 along with multiple table sizes allowing shops the capability of machining larger workpieces with extreme rigidity and speed.Optional table partition (removable) allows the flexibility of a standard machine and that of 2 pallet.
