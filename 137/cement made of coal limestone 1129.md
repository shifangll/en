## How Cement Is Made
How cement is made and history of Portland Cement Portland cement is the basic ingredient of concrete.Concrete is formed when portland cement creates a paste …Emissions from the Cement IndustryThough “cement” and “concrete” are often used interchangeably,concrete is actually the final product made from cement.The primary component of cement is limestone.To produce cement,limestone and other clay like materials are heated in a kiln at 1400&#176;C and then ground to form a lumpy,solid substance called clinker; clinker is then combined with gypsum to form cement.

## Cement Manufacturing Process: What is Cement made of.
Cement manufacturing process &amp; what is cement made of,it can be discussed conveniently under two headings: Selection of Raw materials and manufacturing methods.Raw Materials of Cement.Most important raw materials (what is cement made of) required in the manufacture of Portland Cement are: Limestone,Clay,Gypsum,Fuel,and Water (in wet method).Calcium carbonateLimestone is also the main constituent of cement and concrete.In cement making Cement is made by first mixing limestone and substances such as clays (which contain silica,alumina and iron(III) oxide) to a fine powder.The mixture is crushed and fed into a rotary kiln,which is an iron pipe,90 m long and approximately 6 m in diameter.The pipe is rotated and heated to about 1700 K by.
