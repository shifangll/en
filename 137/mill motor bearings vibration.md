## 5 most common causes of bearing failures in electric.
Damage from vibration Motors that are transported without the rotor shaft held securely in place can be subjected to vibrations within the bearing clearance that could damage the bearings.Similarly,if a motor is at a standstill and subjected to external vibrations over a period of time,the bearings can also become damaged.BALL MILL GEARBOX PROBLEMthe pillow block spherical roller bearings.• As this motor operates on sleeve bearings,it is very doubtful that this vibration originates from the motor.It is much more likely being transmitted to the motor from the ball mill pillow block bearings.
