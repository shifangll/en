## Bituminous Coal Characteristics and Applications
Bituminous coal can be categorized further by the level of volatile matter; it contains high volatile A,B,and C,medium volatile,and low volatile.Volatile matter includes any material that is liberated from the coal at high temperatures.In the case of coal,theCoal Student EnergyThis coal generally has a lower sulfur content than other types,which makes it attractive for use because it burns cleaner.Bituminous coal (45% % carbon): Black and sometimes dark brown,often with well defined bands of bright and dull material.

## Fact check: Does Australia export cleaner coal than many …
Australia,in contrast to Europe,regards sub bituminous coal as black coal.Brown coal (lignite) is classed as a low rank coal because it has a high ash and moisture content,and less carbon.(PDF) Study on dielectric properties of high organic sulfur …High sulfur coal,as an alternative coal source,has a relatively high proportion in coal reserves.However,the feature of high sulfur content,which can cause environmental pollution and poor.

## Diesel fuel explained
Before 2006,most diesel fuel sold in the United States contained high quantities of sulfur.Sulfur in diesel fuel produces air pollution emissions that are harmful to human health.In 2006,the U.S.Environmental Protection Agency issued requirements to reduce the sulfur content of diesel fuel sold for use in the United States.Know the Sulfur Content of Your Diesel FuelThe sulfur content has been greatly reduced in recent months,and it is critical that you know the sulfur content of the fuel you are using in your diesel engines on the farm.
