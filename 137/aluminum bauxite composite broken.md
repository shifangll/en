## How aluminum is made
Aluminum compounds occur in all types of clay,but the ore that is most useful for producing pure aluminum is bauxite.Bauxite consists of 60% aluminum oxide,along with various impurities such as sand,iron,and other metals.Jb Weld Can Repair Steel&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;How To Fix Absolutely Anything with JB weld.If you don't have the tools to weld you can use JBweld to fix or repair anything from automotive radiators,boat.

## Aluminium
Aluminium (aluminum in American and Canadian English) is a chemical element with the symbol Al and atomic number 13.It is a silvery white,soft,non magnetic and ductile metal in the boron group.By mass,aluminium makes up about 8% of the Earth's crust,where it is the third most abundant element (after oxygen and silicon) and also the most abundant metal.AluminumIt takes around 2 3 kg of bauxite (aluminum ore) to make just 1 kg of pure aluminum metal.Commercial ingots of aluminum are huge and weigh around 16 tons.It takes over 20 times less energy to make pure aluminum from recycled cans than from bauxite.
