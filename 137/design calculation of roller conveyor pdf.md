At high conveyor speed,the balance of the roller is of particular importance,especially when we consider the requirements of todays conveyor equipment The out of balance force of a roller at low speed does not have a great effect,but when medium speeds (1,5 2 m sec) are used,vibrations may be induced which may damage the bearings and which.Belt Conveyors for Bulk Materials Calculations by CEMA 5 Edition …Belt Conveyor Capacity Table 1.Determine the surcharge angle of the material.The surcharge angle,on the average,will be 5 degrees to 15 degrees less than the angle of repose.(ex.27 12 = 15 ) 2.Determine the density of the material in pounds per(lb ft
