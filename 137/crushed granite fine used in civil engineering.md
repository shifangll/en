## Sieve analysis
A sieve analysis (or gradation test) is a practice or procedure used (commonly used in civil engineering) to assess the particle size distribution (also called gradation) of a granular material by allowing the material to pass through a series of sieves of progressively smaller mesh size and weighing the amount of material that is stopped by each sieve as a fraction of the whole mass.Suitability of Crushed Cow Bone as Partial Replacement of Fine …Suitability of Crushed Cow Bone as Partial Replacement of Fine Aggregates for Concrete Production Christopher A.Fapohundaa,Ψ,Abiodun Y.Akinsanyab,Samuel O.Aderojuc and Kamaru A.Shittud a Department of Civil Engineering,Federal University,Oye;
