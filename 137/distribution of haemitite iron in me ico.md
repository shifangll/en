## Hematite Physical
Hematite is dense and hard,it is the most important ore of iron because of its high iron content and its abundance.The mineral occurs in various habits: steel gray crystals and coarse grained varieties with a brilliant metallic luster are known as specular hematite.Hematite Mineral DataHematite Rutile Comments: Acicular,golden yellow crystals of rutile epitaxially overgrown on black crystals of hematite.The overgrowths are perpendicular to the trigonal crystallography of the hematite.Location: Novo Horizonte,Bahia Brazil.Scale: 4 x 3.5 x 3 cm.
