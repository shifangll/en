## Aggregates for Concrete
Key points • ‘Aggregate’ is a term for any particulate material.It includes gravel,crushed stone,sand,slag,recycled concrete and geosynthetic aggregates.Aggregate may be natural,manufactured or recycled.• Aggregates make up some 60 % of the concreteWhat is the Cement: sand: aggregate: water ratio for …Answer baipalli inod kumar take the ratio 1:1.5:3 cement =1 sand =1.5 metal =3 So what is the ratio we want to mixing 1+1.5+3=5.5 Volum of wet cement concret is 1.54 to 1.57 unit weight of cement bag is 1440 kg cum one bag of cement = 50 1440 = 0.034722

## concrete
A ratio by weight of 0.5 water,1 cement,3 sand,and 3 gravel should make a fine concrete,although a little less water (0.4 by weight) would make stronger concrete.The same by volume ( ie.buckets) is a good ratio as well,1 2 to 1 to 3 to 3 (or a little less water too much water weakens the concrete,and there will always be some water content in the sand).Concrete Mix RatiosConcrete mix ratio of 1:3:3 On mixing 1 part cement,3 parts sand with 3 parts aggregate produces concrete with a compressive strength of 3000 psi.On mixing water with the three ingredients,a paste is formed that binds them together till the concrete mix gets hardened.
