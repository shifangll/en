## Explain dry and wet process of cement manufacturing
In Pakistan,both Wet and Dry processes are being used for the cement.The dry process although cheaper needs excessive fine grinding.It is more suited for the hard material (Fig 3.1) The specific feature of the wet process is that the raw materials are prepared in water whereas in the dry process the materials are ground and mixed dry.Cement manufacturing process,Portland cement …&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;Cement manufacturing process.′ Must watch this video and Share with your Friends.Mill,Hammer,Ball mill &amp; others 👇👇👇
