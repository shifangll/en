## Gold Extraction from Different Types of Ore
The choice of gold extraction process is closely related to the type of gold ore.Because the type of gold ore,determines the applicable process of gold mine to a large extent.This article introduces different types of gold ores and their applicable extraction processes.Introduction to Mineral ProcessingGold,silver,copper,lead,zinc,molybdenum,iron,potash,phosphate,and even sand for glass are often processed by froth flotation.Without froth flotation,many of the metals and minerals used every day in our modern world would be much more expensive.
