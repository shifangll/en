## Prosper Gold Receives Phase 2, Mining Information
Prosper Gold Corp begins testing vein continuity at the Ashley Gold Project and commences groundwork at the Matachewan Project next to the Young Davidson Mine,The intersection is a 2m quartz vein in an 8m section of anomalous gold in syenite quartz porphyry As these are the first holes at this target follow up is required to test.Bidimensional empirical mode decomposition (BEMD) for …A bidimensional empirical mode decomposition (BEMD) program on a MATLAB platform was effectively used to handle gravity signals for the Tongshi gold field.This yielded a two dimensional intrinsic mode function (IMF 3) image that meticulously depicts the spatial distribution relationship between various gold deposits and the different geological units of the gold field.
