## Thermal conductivity
Thermal conductivity Designing Buildings Wiki Share your construction industry knowledge.Thermal conductivity (sometimes referred to as k value or lambda value (λ)) is a measure of the rate at which temperature differences transmit through a material.The lower the thermal conductivity of a material,the slower the rate at which temperature differences transmit through it,and so the.
