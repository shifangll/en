## Photochemical Instability of CdSe Nanocrystals Coated by …
The photochemical instability of CdSe nanocrystals coated by hydrophilic thiols was studied nondestructively and systematically in water.The results revealed that the photochemical instability of the nanocrystals actually included three distinguishable processes,namely the photocatalytic oxidation of the thiol ligands on the surface of nanocrystals,the photooxidation of the nanocrystals.Environmental Biosensors Biosensor Polychlorinated …Aptamer based sensors have been developed to detect components of the Listeria monocytogenes bacteria.One platform uses magnetic beads conjugated to DNA aptamers for target detection and also investigated therapeutic applications for this platform.
