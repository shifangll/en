Evidence that the price of Tellurium is far from being a trivial consideration to future growth can be seen within the explicit description of this risk factor by First Solar in its annual K fillings with the U.S.Securities and Exchange Commission.How solar cell is madeCharles Fritts,in the 1880s,also used gold coated selenium to make the first solar cell,again only one percent efficient.Nevertheless,Fritts considered his cells to be revolutionary.He envisioned free solar energy to be a means of decentralization,predicting that solar cells would replace power plants with individually powered residences.

## Tellurium
Tellurium is essential to several different modern technologies such as solar panels and thermoelectric generators which make up 70% of tellurium demand.In the coming years,these markets are.Tellurium (Te)Tellurium is added to lead to improve its durability,strenght and resistence to corrosion.It can be used for cast iron,ceramics,blasting caps,solar panels,chalcogenide glasses.When added to rubber,tellurium speeds up the curing process and makes the product less susceptible to ageing and less likely to be affected by oil,which softens normal rubber.
