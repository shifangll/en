## Stress Strain Behaviour of Concrete
A typical relationship between stress and strain for normal strength concrete is presented in Figure 1.After an initial linear portion lasting up to about 30 40% of the ultimate load,the curve becomes non linear,with large strains being registered for small increments of stress.The non linearity is primarily a function of the coalescence of microcracks at the paste aggregate interface.Strength of Concrete (PSI) ProMatcherThe strength of concrete is measure in terms of pounds per square inch (or PSI).PSI is a measure of compressive strength,or the ability of the material to carry loads and handle compression…
