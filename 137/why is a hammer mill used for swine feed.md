One of the most interesting and useful pieces of equipment on our old farm is a hammer mill,which was designed to take grain or hay and grind it down into a consistency that can be more easily used in a feed mix,or more readily be eaten and digested bMeasuring Feed Particle SizeThe pig's digestive system will digest the feed better because the digestive enzymes have more surface area to act upon the in the nutrients in the feed.Digestibility of protein,energy and other nutrients is generally improved with at the more optimal feed particle size.Improving digestibility sho

They point out that producers should use a 3 16 in.screen or smaller to get a hammer mill to grind corn to 700 800 microns.(See Table 1.) The team also found a significant difference in average particle size of feed from on farm or elevator operated hammer mills.On farm grindingHammer mills: hammermillsOptimal hammer design and placement will provide maximum contact with the feed ingredient.Hammer mills in which the rotor speed is approximately 1,800 rpm,should be using hammers which are around 25cm (~ 10 inches) long,6.35cm (~2.5 inches) wide,and 6.4mm (0.25 inches) thick.

## A diet fit for a pig: seven basic rules
Pigs will eat whole grain but this will pass straight through and show in the manure.Grain that is processed is more easily digested by the pig and there is less feed wasted.The recommended particle size for pigs is 0.7mm or 700 microns.Use of hammer mills or roller mills breaks the grain toHints on Feeding Feeding and Nutrition Beef Livestock …Hammer milling makes the hay too fine thus reducing its roughage qualities.If using a hammer mill to process the hay,use the largest sieve size to optimise fibre length.Feeding grain and hay separately is likely to give uneven results as some cattle will eat large …
