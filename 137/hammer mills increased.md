## Fine Grinding Hammer Mill Schutte Hammermill
Hammer mills work on the principle that most materials will crush,shatter,or pulverize upon impact.Material is fed into the mill’s chamber through the feed chute,typically by gravity,where it is struck by ganged hammers attached to a shaft that rotates at high speed inside the mill’s grinding chamber.Hammer mills: hammermillsOptimal hammer design and placement will provide maximum contact with the feed ingredient.Hammer mills in which the rotor speed is approximately 1,800 rpm,should be using hammers which are around 25cm (~ 10 inches) long,6.35cm (~2.5 inche
