## Magnetic Separation: The Basics
Magnetic separation is one of the most common ways to separate magnetic materials in different industries.We break down the basics of magnetic separation.Magnetic separation has been around for decades,and people traditionally used electromagnetics for.Magnetic Separation of Metal Ions The Journal of …The magnetic separation was investigated for Co2+ (9500 &#215; 6 cm3 mol ) and Fe3+ (14600 &#215; 6 cm3 mol ) ions and for Cr3+ (6200 &#215; 6 cm3 mol ) and Al3+ (−2 &#215; 6 cm3 mol ) ions.The metal ion solutions were spotted on a silica gel support,and exposed to a magnetic field of 410 kOe2 cm intensity &#215; gradient.The Co2+ ions move farther toward the maximum field than the Fe3.

## Magnetic Separation
Carrier magnetic separation has been proposed for more effective separation of water and solids from acid mine water to generate very pure water (Feng et al.2000).As discussed in Chapter 10,dissolved heavy metals like zinc and copper can be recovered from acid mine drainage (AMD) by selective precipitation controlling the pH for the precipitation of specific metals.Magnetic separationEsselent solutions for oil separation,filtration and magnetic separation.Separating magnetizable particles.In the metal industry,a very large portion of the particles that need to be removed are metal and lots of those are magnetizable,which makes the use of.
