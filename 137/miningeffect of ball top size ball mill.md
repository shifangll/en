## Calculation of Top Grinding Media Size Ball Sizing
The majority of grinding balls are forged carbon or alloy steels.Generally,they are spherical,but other shapes have been used.The choice of the top (or recharge) ball size can be made using empirical equations developed by Bond (1958) or Azzaroni (1984) or by using special batch grinding tests interpreted iHow to Size a Ball Mill Design Calculator &amp; Formula﻿ A) Total Apparent Volumetric Charge Filling including balls and excess slurry on top of the ball charge,plus the interstitial voids in between the balls expressed as a percentage of the net internal mill volume (inside liners).B) Overflow Discharge Mills operating at low ball fillings slurry may accumulate on t
