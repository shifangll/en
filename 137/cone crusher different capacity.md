## Cone Crusher
The cone crusher is therefore an excellent arrested crusher.The flare of the bowl allows a much greater head angle than in the gyratory crusher,while retaining the same angle between the crushing members.This gives the cone crusher a high capacity,since the capacity of gyratory crushers is roughly proportional toJaw Crusher Capacity ParameterThe capacity of small jaw crusher is from 1t h 5t h,while the large scale jaw crusher is 200t h 1000t h.Jaw crushing experiments show that the capacity of a jaw crusher is dependent upon fracture toughness and the elastic modulus.

## Cone Crushers
Cone crushers are used in AG and SAG grinding circuits to increase tonnage by effectively dealing with any pebble (critical size) build up problem.Normally,heavy duty short head crushers are employed to crush pebbles.Power and crusher cavity level are the key variables for monitoring and controlling the crusher operation.Gyratory and Cone CrusherIn doing so,the crusher products have different size distributions.The movement of the mantle or conical head that performs the crushing action can be visualised in Figure 5.2,where it can be seen that as the feed drops down.Capacity of Gyratory and
