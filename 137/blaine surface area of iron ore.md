## Iron Ore and Pellets
Vale is the world’s biggest producer of iron ore and pellets,raw materials essential to the manufacture of steel.Iron ore is found in nature in the form of rocks,mixed with other elements.By means of various industrial processes incorporating cutting edgeMining of Iron Ores IspatGuruIron ore is almost exclusively mined by surface operations.The most predominant surface mining methods used for mining of iron ores are open pit mining methods and open cut mining methods.However a few underground iron ore mines are also in operation around the globe.

## Mining
Mining Mining Underground mining: When any ore body lies a considerable distance below the surface,the amount of waste that has to be removed in order to uncover the ore through surface mining becomes prohibitive,and underground techniques must be.Iron in groundwaterIron in rural groundwater supplies is a common problem: its concentration level ranges from 0 to 50 mg l,while WHO recommended level is &lt; 0.3 mg l.The iron occurs naturally in the aquifer but levels in groundwater can be increased by dissolution of ferrous.

## Iron ore
Increasing iron ore demand,coupled with the depletion of high grade hematite ores in the United States,after World War II led to development of lower grade iron ore sources,principally the utilization of magnetite and taconite.Iron ore mining methods vary by theHow iron is madeIron oxides are the most common.Those minerals near the surface of the earth that have the highest iron content are known as iron ores and are mined commercially.Iron ore is converted into various types of iron through several processes.
