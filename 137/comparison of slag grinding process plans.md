## Slag Cement Association
Slag cement is a recovered byproduct of the iron manufacturing process and can be used to replace a portion of portland cement in concrete mix design.The use of slag cement has demonstrated long term performance enhancements allowing designers to reduce.Ore processing Waihi GoldOre processing consists of the following stages: crushing and grinding of the ore addition of process water (generally decanted from the tailings pond) to form a slurry addition of lime to the ore,and cyanide solution to the slurry,to leach the gold and silver into
