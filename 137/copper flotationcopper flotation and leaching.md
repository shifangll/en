## Statistical Evaluation and Optimization of Factors Affecting …
Copper flotation waste is an industrial by product material produced from the process of manufacturing copper.The main concern with respect to landfilling of copper flotation waste is the release of elements (e.g.salts and heavy metals) when in contact with water,that is,leaching.Copper flotation waste generally contains a significant amount of Cu together with trace elements of other.Effect of Copper and Iron Ions on the Sulphidizing …Abstract The treatment of smelting slag has attracted much attention nowadays.This study investigates the influence of Na 2 S,CuSO 4,and FeCl 3 on sulphidizing flotation of copper oxide.The results show that a proper Cu 2+ concentration can increase the sulphidizing effect of copper oxide,while Fe 3+ inhibits the sulphidizing effect.
