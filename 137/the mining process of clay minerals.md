## Learn About Bentonite Mining in Wyoming
Mining & Processing Bentonite is surface mined through a process called back casting where reclamation is performed by filling the mining pits with soils from subsequent pits while the mine is in production Typically the topsoil layer is about 30 inches deep,which is removed using heavy equipmentProcess for treatment of mineral clay slurry HARTUNG,[0003] Mineral fines such as aqueous clay slurries are routinely formed during mineral mining process For example,in the mining of phosphate ore or matrix (consisting essentially of phosphate,sand,and clay),the phosphate matrix is generally washed with,
