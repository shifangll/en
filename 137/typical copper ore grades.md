## Copper Concentrates
The average grade of copper ores in the 21st century is below 0.6% copper,with a proportion of economic ore minerals (including copper) being less than 2% of the total volume of the ore rock.A key objective in the metallurgical treatment of any ore is theDrilling ResultsOf course it is not only the grade that count since there are a lot of profitable mining operations around the world which are developing low to medium grade ore.Therefore it is better to use gram meters instead of only looking at the grade when comparing the drill results of different companies.

There is a more glaring problem with this article that shows a general lack of understanding and it is in the opening comment “The grade or concentration of a mineral or metal in ore directly.Learning Goals: What is an ore deposit?Typical mines today have ore grades of only 0.6 percent copper.Since metal concentrations occur at much lower grades,the copper concentrations are measured in parts per million (ppm).If a sample has 1ppm copper,this means that in 1 million lbs of rock
