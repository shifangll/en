## Difference Between Sag Mill vs Ball Mill
&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;SAG mill make use of steel balls included with some large and hard rocks for grinding.These mills utilize the balls in making the large fragments of materials broken into pieces.The ball charge of a SAG mill is about 9% to 20%.This process takes place inside the large rotating drum of SAG mill which is filled with balls partially.Ball MillWhat is a Ball Mill? Ball Mill is the key equipment for grinding after the crushing process,which is widely used in the manufacture industries,such as cement,silicate,new building material,refractory material,fertilizer,ferrous metal,nonferrous metal and glass ceramics and can be used for the dry and wet grinding for all kinds of ores and other grind able materials.
