## Drill
Capacity.Drilling capacity indicates the maximum diameter a given power drill or drill press can produce in a certain material.It is essentially a proxy for the continuous torque the machine is capable of producing.Typically a given drill will have its capacity specified for different materials,i.e.10mm for steel,25mm for wood,etc.Measuring Capacity in Manufacturing for Supply ChainCompanies use two measures of capacity—theoretical and rated.The theoretical capacity is defined as the maximum output capacity that does not allow for any downtime,whereas the rated capacity is the output capacity that can be used for calculation purposes

## Compressor Capacity
Modern spinning mills prefer to opt for the centralized large compressor which gives high efficiency.The installation costs as well as their maintenance costs are lower than those for separate compressor.This capacity control method is most effective when the continuous usage is less than 50% of maximum capacity.Steel Industry Datamore detailed summary of steel production based on data supplied by companies representing 75% of U.S.production capacity.Note: Capability for the Fourth Quarter 2019 is approximately 30.4 million tons compared to 30.8 million tons for the same.
