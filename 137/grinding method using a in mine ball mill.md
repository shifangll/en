ABSTRACT The run of mine ore from Aghdarreh gold mine must be comminuted to achieve the desired degree of liberation of gold particles.Currently,comminution circuits include a single stage crushing using a jaw crusher and a single stage grinding using a Semi Autogenous Grinding (SAG) mill in closed circuit with aGrinding Balls &amp; RodsThese balls may be had in two types: a soft ball Brinnell 450+ for large diameter ball mills,and a hard ball Brinnell 600+ for small ball mills.The addition of molybdenum,chromium and manganese provides an excellent microstructure for these grinding balls.Balls are available in 4″,3&#189;”,3″,2&#189;”,and 2″ sizes.
