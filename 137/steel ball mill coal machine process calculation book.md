## Ball Milling
Ball milling technique,using mechanical alloying and mechanical milling approaches were proposed to the word wide in the 8th decade of the last century for preparing a wide spectrum of powder materials and their alloys.In fact,ball milling process is not new and dates back to more than 150 years.It has been used in size comminutions of ore,mineral dressing,preparingTechnical Report UDC 621.771.25.The bar mill of the Yawata Works used to produce commercial grade steel typically used as an architectural material with two high rolling mills (8 stand roughing rolling mill,4 stand intermediate rolling mill,and 4 stand finishing rolling mill) was built by Morgan Sumitomo He

## Ball Mill
The ball mill is a tumbling mill that uses steel balls as the grinding media.The length of the cylindrical shell is usually 1 1.5 times the shell diameter (Figure 8.11).The feed can be dry,with less than 3% moisture to minimize ball coating,or slurry containing 20 40% water by weight.Energy Saving Ball mill,Ball grinder,Ball grinding mill.Ball mill grinding machine is a kind of horizontal drum type grinding mill with external gear and double bins.Materials goes evenly through quill shaft in feeding device into the first bin,which has ladder lining or ripple lining with steel balls in different specifications.Steel balls are taken to a certain height by centrifugal force from.
