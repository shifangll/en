## Desulphurization of High Sulfur Coal by Mild Pyrolysis …
A processing route involving low temperature carbonization followed by dry magnetic separation is put forward for the desulfurization and deashing of typical low rank lignitic coals.Magnetic SeparationCarrier magnetic separation has been proposed for more effective separation of water and solids from acid mine water to generate very pure water (Feng et al.2000).As discussed in Chapter 10,dissolved heavy metals like zinc and copper can be recovered from acid mine drainage (AMD) by selective precipitation controlling the pH for the precipitation of specific metals.
