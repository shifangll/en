## HOW TO DETERMINE OF BOND STRENGTH BETWEEN …
Theory The bond strength is the measure of the effectiveness of the grip between concrete and steel and has no standard quantitative definition.In pull out tests on plain bars,the maximum load generally represents the bond strength that can be developed betweenTable of concrete design properties (fcd,fctm,Ecm,fctd)Table of concrete design properties according to Eurocode 2 (EN 1) including compressive strength,tensile strength,elastic modulus,min.reinforcement Concrete Design Properties according to EN 1 (γ c = 1.50,f yk = 500 MPa)Symbol Description
