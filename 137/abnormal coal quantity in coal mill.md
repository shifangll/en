## control of coal mill
CN203560703U Coal mill bearing lubrication system,The utility model relates to a coal mill bearing lubrication system,and aims to solve the problems that in the prior art,when a coal mill bearing lubrication system operates,owing to long operating time of an oil pump,mechanical wear is high,oil amount is adjusted frequently,since oil excess,oil lack or oil finish occur often.PulverizerIn 1954 a Jet Pulverizer was developed in which operates like a Vertical Pulverizer only the item is pulverized by the high speed air action.For example,forcing coal against coal.Bowl mill.Similar to the vertical roller mill,it also uses tires to crush coal.There are two types,a deep bowl mill,and a shallow bowl mill.High speed
