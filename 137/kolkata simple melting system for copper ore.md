## Copper
Copper does not react with water,but it does slowly react with atmospheric oxygen to form a layer of brown black copper oxide which,unlike the rust that forms on iron in moist air,protects the underlying metal from further corrosion (passivation).A green layer of verdigris (copper carbonate) can often be seen on old copper structures,such as the roofing of many older buildings and the.How copper is madeMost of the copper ores mined in the United States contain only about 1.1.6% copper by weight.The most common sulfide ore is chalcopyrite,CuFeS 2,also known as copper pyrite or yellow copper ore.Chalcocite,Cu 2 S,is another
