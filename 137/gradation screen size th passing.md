## Determine Particle Size Distribution of Soil by Sieving
To Determine Particle Size Distribution of Soil by Sieving The soil is sieved through a set of sieves.The material retained on different sieves is determined.The cumulative percentage of the material retained C n = P 1 + P 2 + P 3 + ..+P n Where P 1,P 2 etc are the percentages retained on sieve 1,2 etc which are coarser than sieve ‘n’.CHAPTER 2 SIEVE ANALYSIS AND FINENESS MODULUS SamplingCHAPTER 2 SIEVE ANALYSIS AND FINENESS MODULUS Sampling Since the reason for sampling aggregates is to determine the gradation (particle size) of the aggregate,it is necessary that they be sampled correctly.The results of testing will re&quot; ect the

## Gradation and Size
The particle size distribution,or gradation,of an aggregate is one of the most influential aggregate characteristics in determining how it will perform as a pavement material.In HMA,gradation helps determine almost every important property including stiffness,stability,durability,permeability,workability,fatigue resistance,frictional resistance and moisture susceptibility (Roberts et.U.S.and Metric Sieve SizesOpening sizes and mesh diameters for test sieves are often duplicated between these two standards,making it easier to select the proper sieve size for your material.The above table is a list of all available sieves in U.S.and metric sizes for both ASTM E11 and
