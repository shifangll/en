## Electric Motor Bearing Greasing Basics
The temperature may briefly rise,then fall,once grease has passed through the bearing.The shear stresses and temperature reduce the viscosity of the grease,allowing it to flow.While some grease is moved into the motor housing,due to Couetti Flow,the amount is considerably less than if the motor …The Hot Issue of Motor Temperature Ratings EC&amp;MUnderstanding motor insulation classes and temperature ratings is simpler than you might think.Though we're focusing on standard AC induction motors,you can apply most of this information to DC motors.Let's begin by looking at motor temperature terms.
