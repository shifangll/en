## Concrete Mix Ratios
Concrete mix ratio is a vital topic in concrete mix design.The four basic ingredients for making concrete are: Portland cement,sand,aggregate (stone) and water.The strength of concrete mixture depends on the ratio in which these four ingredients are mixed.Chapter 4: mix design calculation sheet for 40 N mm2 concrete mix …Proportion of gradients per trial mix 3(SSD) of : 0.0083m (For small mixer) Cement = 3.7 kg Water = 1.7 kg Fine aggregate = 5.7 kg Coarse aggregate = 8.2 kg This trial will make about 20 kg of concrete; enough for slump and Vebe
