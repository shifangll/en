## What are the different types of coal?
Coal is a fossil fuel which is formed by the decomposition and degradation of plant,vegetation and animal life over a period of million of years under the pressure of earth.The energy which we get after burning of these fossil fuels is the same.What are the different types of coal? American …The coal formation process involves the burial of peat,which is made of partly decayed plant materials,deep underground.The heat and pressure of burial alters the texture and increases the carbon content of the peat,which transforms it into coal,a type of sedimentary rock.This process takes millions of years.Types,or “ranks,” of coal are determined by carbon content.There are four.
