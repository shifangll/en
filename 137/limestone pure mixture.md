## The chemistry of limestone: teacher&#39s notes
The chemical and physical properties of limestone,especially when reasonably pure,make it highly sought after for hundreds of everyday uses.With salt and coal,it formed the main feedstock for the chemical industry until about 1914.It is still important today as shown by the wide range of uses in Tables 1 4 (Appendix).What is the proportion of cement constituents (that is limestone andFor pure raw materials limestone with low content of clay,clay with low content of CaO and an LSF≈96,an average raw mix composition is ~80% limestone and The most important uses of cement are as a component in the production of mortar in masonry,and of concrete,a combination of cement and an aggregate to&nbsp
