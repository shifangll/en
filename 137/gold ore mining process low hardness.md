From ore to dor&#233; Cyanidation More gold is recovered by cyanidation than by any other process.In cyanidation,metallic gold is oxidised and dissolved in an alkaline cyanide solution.When gold dissolution is complete,the gold bearing solution is separated from theCopper Mining and Processing: Processing of Copper Ores …Copper processing is a complicated process that begins with mining of the ore (less than 1% copper) and ends with sheets of 99.99% pure copper called cathodes,which will ultimately be made into products for everyday use.The most common types of ore,copper oxide and copper sulfide,undergo two different processes,hydrometallurgy and pyrometallurgy,respectively,due to the different.
