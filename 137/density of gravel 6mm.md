## Asphalt Calculator
Our asphalt calculator uses an average density does not offer customization of this computational parameter.You will need another tarmac calculator if the density differs significantly in your case.Most asphalt has a lifespan of over 20 years if applied and maintained appropriately,and if it is not subject to significantly higher loads than it was planned for.Unit Weight of Materials Used at Construction SiteFollowing table shows unit weight of materials used at construction site.Please note this is for reference purpose only and may vary from place and type of material.We are thankful to Engineer Ravi Verma for submitting this very useful information to us.If you also.

## Conversion Tables for …
Conversion Tables Have you ever struggled to convert units of measure from one to another or m&#179; of a material to kg ? For example,concrete is measured as m&#179;,but if mixing on site the separate constituents are purchased by weight and despite having used metric.What is the weight of a mm coarse aggregate in 1 cubic …Crushed Stone of 20mm is having wt.of 1600 kg cum so,Ans is 1600 kg or 1.6 ton If talking in general terms it's about 1500 1750kg per cum.For accurate calculation,we will be needing Bulk density of Agg and Vol of air and specific gravity of Aggregate first.
