## Copper
Copper does not react with water,but it does slowly react with atmospheric oxygen to form a layer of brown black copper oxide which,unlike the rust that forms on iron in moist air,protects the underlying metal from further corrosion (passivation).A green layer of verdigris (copper carbonate) can often be seen on old copper structures,such as the roofing of many older buildings and the.COPPER CONCENTRATE (PROMINENT HILL) Material Safety Data …COPPER CONCENTRATE (PROMINENT HILL) OZ MINERALS PROMINENT HILL 170 Greenhill Road.Parkside,SA,AUSTRALIA,5063 (08) 8229 6600 Synonym(s) Use(s) SDS Date (08) 8672 8100 mark.weidenbach@ozminerals.coin 2.HAZARDS
