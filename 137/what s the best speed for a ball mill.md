## Ball Mills
As for Rod Mills,the image above best expresses what is going on inside.As rocks is feed into the mill,they are crushed (pinched) by the weight of its 3.5” x 16’ rods at one end while the smaller particles migrate towards the discharge end and get slightly abraded (as in a Ball Mill) on the way there.Optimum Ball Mill Speed.Ball millA ball mill,a type of grinder,is a cylindrical device used in grinding (or mixing) materials like ores,chemicals,ceramic raw materials and paints.Ball mills rotate around a horizontal axis,partially filled with the material to be ground plus the grinding medium.Different materials are used as media,including ceramic balls,flint pebbles and
