Tables 1 through 5 have gradation guidelines for D50s of 4 inches through 12 inch The smaller (ie,1 and 2 inch) diameters shown should be considered as “weight of material” rather than “number of rock” The tables can be used to produce gradation sample piles showing the upper and lower limits of the desired gradation
