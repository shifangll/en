## Optimization of Reduction Parameters of Quenched …
To improve the reducibility of titaniferous magnetite ore (TMO),a technique of high temperature heating followed by water quenching has been adapted.This quenching technique imparts cracks into the dense TMO which in turn leads to the enhancement of reducibility during carbothermal reduction using boiler grade coal.A major problem associated with TMO is that the reducibility of the ore is.Magnetite Palabora Mining Company LtdApproximately 15%,by weight,of magnetite is removed by 'cleaning' and 're cleaning' of the magnetic concentrate from the first stage This results in the upgrading of magnetite to 66% Fe (greater than 95% magnetite) This upgraded magnetite is then subjected to elutriation,to generate medium and coarse grade,

## Ernest Henry Mining: Magnetite Processing
What is magnetite? Magnetite (Fe3O4),like hematite (Fe2O3),is a form of iron ore It is a benign and highly magnetic substance used primarily in steel manufacturing and coal washing Magnetite occurs in nearly all igneous and metamorphic rocks and usually only,what is magnetite miningThe main iron mineral in magnetite ore is the ferrous iron oxide magnetite (Fe 3 O 4) Magnetite ore requires complex processing to separate magnetite minerals from other minerals in the ore to produce an almost pure magnetite concentrate with an iron content of between 68% Fe and 70% Fe that is highly sought after by steel makers
