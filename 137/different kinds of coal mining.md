## Coal
Coal is a combustible black or brownish black sedimentary rock,formed as rock strata called coal seams.Coal is mostly carbon with variable amounts of other elements; chiefly hydrogen,sulfur,oxygen,and nitrogen.[1] Coal is formed when dead plant matter decays into peat and is converted into coal by the heat and pressure of deep burial over.What are the main methods of mining? American …There are four main mining methods: underground,open surface (pit),placer,and in situ mining.Underground mines are more expensive and are often used to reach deeper deposits.Surface mines are typically used for more shallow and less valuable deposits.Placer mining is used to sift out valuable metals from sediments in river channels,beach sands,or other environments.In situ mining.
