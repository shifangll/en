## Bentonite
Bentonite ( ˈbɛntənʌɪt )[1] is an absorbent aluminium phyllosilicate clay consisting mostly of montmorillonite.One of the first occurrences of bentonite was found in the Cretaceous Benton Shale near Rock River,Wyoming.The Fort Benton Group,along with others in stratigraphic succession,was named after Fort Benton,Montana in the mid.Ca Na Montmorillonite: Structure,Forces and Swelling …Ca Na montmorillonite and natural Wyoming bentonite (MX ) have been studied experimentally and theoretically.For a clay system in equilibrium with pure water,Monte Carlo simulations predict a large swelling when the clay counterions are monovalent,while in.
