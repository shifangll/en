## FINENESS OF CEMENT BY DRY SIEVING (IS: Part 1 …
Dear sir We have studied that while doing the fineness of cement not more than 10% cement retained on the 90 micron sieve,but when i studied Is 4031 part,i did not see in code these words.so sir please justify me is it is right or wrong ? if right then give meParticle Size Analysis (for soils sediments) — UCL …The procedure of determining the proportion of mineral particles in each of these classes is called particle size analysis or mechanical analysis of the soil.In soil analysis,the proportion of gravel and larger particles is determined by first grinding the soil to disaggregate it and then passing it through a 2 mm sieve.
