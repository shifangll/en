Density is an important parameter for aggregate.For aggregates,density is determined by multiplying the relative density (specific gravity) of the aggregate times the density of water.Bulk Density of Aggregate [1]The bulk density or unit weight of an aggregate is the mass or weight of the aggregate that required to fill a container of a specified unit volume.INDEX OF FIELD TEST PROCEDURES oregongovContent of Aggregate Base Materials 223,2014 Unit Weight and Voids in Aggregate 19,Plastic Fines In Graded Aggregates and Soils by the Use of the Sand Equivalent Test 176 2016 : Theoretical Maximum Specific Gravity and Density of Bituminous Paving Mixtures 209
