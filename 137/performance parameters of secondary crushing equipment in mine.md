## Crushing in Mineral Processing
In mineral processing or metallurgy,the first stage of comminution is crushing.Depending of the type of rock (geometallurgy) to be crushed,there are 2 largely different techniques at your disposition for crushing rocks.In principle,compression crushing is used on hard and abrasive rocks by placing them between a high wear resistant plate surface.Less abrasive and softer rocks or stones.KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORSCarefully selected key performance indicators identify precisely where to take action to improve performance.This paper deals with the identification of key performance indicators for the maintenance function,by first looking at the ways that maintenance
