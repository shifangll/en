## Ore Beneficiation
&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;Development of large magnetic separator models can increase the ore treating capacity,reduce energy consumption,and save space.The largest permanent magnetic drum separator is 1800 mm in diameter and 5000 mm in length,and the capacity for treating magnetite ore is 250 300 ton of feed per hour.1 Froth Flotation Fundamental PrinciplesAfter carrying out a froth flotation separation,the products are as shown in Table 1.Using this data,calculate: (a) Ratio of concentration (b) % Metal Recovery (c) % Metal Loss (d) % Weight Recovery,or % Yield (e) Enrichment Ratio Table 1: Grade recovery performance of a hypothetical copper ore flotation process.

## Mineral processing
In the field of extractive metallurgy,mineral processing,also known as ore dressing,is the process of separating commercially valuable minerals from their ores History.A set of Cornish stamps.a process called &quot;spalling&quot;.Before long,mechanical means were found to achieve this.For instance,stamp mills were used in Samarkand as early.Calculation methods conveyor beltsmachine,the calculation methods here are based on general,simple physical formulae and derivations backed up by factors (c 2) that include a safety margin.In the majority of cases the safety margin used for calcu lation in this brochure will be larger than for the corresponding B Rex calculation.
