## Extraction of Metals from Concentrated Ore: Reduction of …
Extraction of Metals Now we already saw how the ore of a metal is concentrated to remove impurities known as gangue.After concentration of ores,we must now extract metal from in it.This step will give us metal in its pure form i.e.the native form of metal.First.Refining ForgeUsage [edit edit source] To use the Refining Forge,one needs to put either Thatch,Wood,Sparkpowder or Angler Gel inside.See table below for more information.Once the fuel and refining materials are inside the forge,you Light the fire to begin refining.
