## Why is Silicon Used for Electronic Devices?
There are few things that are more complex than electronic devices.Despite this,the simple element silicon (Si) is the basis for most electronics today.Silicon,and the silicon wafers they are made into,power everything from supercomputers to smart phones to air microwave ovens.Manganese Ore ProcessingConcentration—Gravity Methods of treating Manganese Ore The mill feed,drawn from one or more bins,is sampled at the ore feeder discharge to obtain a composite sample for mill control.After elevating,a vibrating screen separates the feed into sizes best.
