## Conveyor Capacity
Conveyor capacity is determined by the belt speed,width and the angle of the belt and can be expressed as Q = ρ A v (1) where Q = conveyor capacity (kg s,lb s) ρ = density of transported material (kg m 3,lb ft 3) A = cross sectional.Calculations for Screw conveyorsWestring 395 T +49 (0)212 64 50 0 info@bechtel wuppertal.de D Wuppertal F +49 (0)212 64 50 10 www.bechtel wuppertal.de Calculations for Screw conveyors Belt speed in m per sec Calculations for screw conveyors Screw diameter (in meters)
