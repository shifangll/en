## 2 Fundamentals of Fuel Consumption Assessment of Fuel.
Before proceeding,it is necessary to define the terms fuel economy and fuel consumption; these two terms are widely used,but very often interchangeably and incorrectly,which can generate confusion and incorrect interpretations:.Fuel economy is a measure of how far a vehicle will travel with a gallon of fuel; it is expressed in miles per gallon.This is a popular measure used for a long.Benjamin Lumber and Fuel 19 Rolling Mill Ln North East,MD.A hidden gem!
