## Effect of Inherent Moisture in Collie Coal on its Pyrolysis …
Abstract: The influences of inherent moisture in Collie coal during pyrolysis has been studied using a series of Collie coal samples,including the raw coal,dilute acid washed coal,and demineralized coal samples of both pulverized fuel and millimeter sizes.Coal without drying (moisture content 20%) and dried coal (moisture &amp;lt;1%) were pyrolyzed under various conditions in a fixed bed.Coal Calculations Mining SGSSGS global teams of chemists and experts use a range of coal analytical calculations and indexes to arrive at the calorific values,total hydrogen,Coke Reactivity Index (CRI) and Coke Strength after Reaction (CSR) of your coal sample.Our third party test results.
