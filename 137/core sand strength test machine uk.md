## Core Sampling and Testing of Concrete and Factors …
Concrete cores are used for testing of actual properties of concrete in existing structures such as strength,permeability,chemical analysis,carbonation Fig: Concrete Core The strength of a concrete core test specimen depends on its shape,proportions and size.What is the difference between the cylinder and cube …When you apply compressive stresses on the Cylindrical Specimen in CTM,due to its height i.e 300mm,the slender effect causes the cylinder to bear comparatively lesser amount of stress,when compared to a Cube(150mm) causing the cylinder to get crus.
