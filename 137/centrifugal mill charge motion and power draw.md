## Centrifugal Pumps
A centrifugal pump converts input power to kinetic energy by accelerating liquid in a revolving device an impeller.The most common is the volute pump where fluid enters the pump through the eye of the impeller which rotates at high speed.The fluid accelerates.JMEused adequately in prediction of charge motion,power draw and segregation in ball mills [4].Furthermore,other investigations such as comparison between numerical modeling and experimental measurements in a pilot SAG mill were done in recent years [5].Optimization of th

## Stirred Media Detritors (SMD)
The power drawn by the SMD motor is required to establish the grinding rate.As the grinding media wears fine enough to exit through the mill screens,the total media charge will diminish,and the power draw will decrease.Media should be added either manually or automatically to maintain as consistent a power draw as possible.Impellers Selection Guide Engineering360&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;Impellers (also spelled impellors or impellars) are rotating devices designed to alter the flow and or pressure of liquids,gases,and vapors.Impellers consist of various vanes — often blade shaped — arranged around a short central shaft.When the shaft and vanes rotate,they suck in fluids or.

## Calculating Power Draw when sizing Ball Mills
The circulating load is a result of the ore hardness,mill power,power efficiency (i.e.size of balls,slurry density,etc),classification efficiency,and product size.The power draw is driven mainly by mill diameter and length,ball and slurry charge level,and rotational speed.
