When contaminating minerals are present the frac sands may come close to meeting API specifications,but still fail from one or two tests For example,calcium carbonates,feldspars and magnetically susceptible minerals can cause crush test failings,or excessive acid solubility Frac sand flowsheetsTEST FOR SILT CONTENT IN SAND YouTubeSep 05,2014&#0183;&#32;The strength and durability of concrete is impacted if there is a high silt content in sand This is why it’s extremely important to test the sand for silt Watch our video to find out how to.
