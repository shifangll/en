## Specific gravity
Specific gravity,also called relative density,is the ratio of the density of a substance to the density of a reference substance; equivalently,it is the ratio of the mass of a substance to the mass of a reference substance for the same given volume.Apparent specific gravity is the ratio of the weight of a volume of the substance to the weight of an equal volume of the reference substance.Bulk Density TableIlmenite ore 140 160 Iron ore concentrate 120 180 Iron oxide pigment 25 Iron oxide millscale 75 Iron pyrites (see ferrous sulfide).Ingredient Bulk Density Table Ingredient Bulk Density (lb cu.ft.)

## Specific Gravity and Bulk Density Mining SGS
“Specific gravity” is the density of a material relative to water.Since rocks are comprised of several distinct mineral phases,they do not have a fixed specific gravity.Instead,a rock’s “bulk density” arises as a result of the percentage of all minerals in a sample multiplied by the specific gravity of each.Relative densityRelative density,or specific gravity,is the ratio of the density (mass of a unit volume) of a substance to the density of a given reference material.Specific gravity for liquids is nearly always measured with respect to water at its densest (at 4 C or 39.2 F); for gases,air …
