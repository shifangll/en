## Gold parting
Gold parting is the separating of gold from silver.Gold and silver are often extracted from the same ores and are chemically similar and therefore hard to separate.Over the centuries special means of separation have been invented.The very earliest precious metals had mixes of gold and silver; gold and silver alloy is called electrum.With.Separation Process of Gold Concentrate From RocksIn the separation of mineral ores there are two separation techniques,ie physical separation by gravity separation and chemical separation by flotation separation: Gravity Separation Separation of gravity: Gravity separation is a mineral separation …
