## The Making of Iron &amp; Steel
4 2 Materials Used to make Steel 2.1 Iron Ore Composition Iron very rarely occurs in the earth's surface as a metal.It is widely distributed,combined with oxygen as iron oxides.In fact it is believed that iron makes up about 5% by weight of the earth's crust.Extraction Of IronExtraction of Iron Step1: Concentration The ore is crushed in crushers and is broken to small pieces.It is concentrated with gravity separation process in which it is washed with water to remove clay,sand,etc.8.Steps of Extraction Step1: Concentration
