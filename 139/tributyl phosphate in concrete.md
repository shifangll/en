## US20040224869A1 Defoamer for concrete admixtures,
The present invention is directed to a defoaming agent for use with polycarboxylate based admixtures for concrete The defoaming agent is comprised of tributyl phosphate,an alkylaryl sulfonic acid metallic salt and a modified alkylpolyalcoxy ester Tributyl phosphate is a phosphate ester based defoamer and the modified alkylpolyalcoxy ester is an air detraining agentDetermining the Surfactant Consistent with Concrete in,(2) Omitting tributyl phosphate as the defoamer,some little foam is produced in concrete due to SDS presence in the compatible surfactant composition and this causes a reduction of concrete mechanical properties with respect to the concrete with the defoamer Then,a higher SDS amount leads to a higher dispersion quality in aqueous phase but.

## The Fifty Year Retrospective Concrete Construction Magazine
Some aggregates have been known to release air into the mix The most widely used air detrainer is tributyl phosphate Dibutyl phosphate,water insoluble alcohols,water insoluble esters of carbonic and boric acids as well as silicones may also do the job Obviously they must be used judiciously for the concrete to end up with the right amount.Plasticizer chemeuropeStrength of concrete is inversely proportional to the amount of water added or water cement (w c) ratio In order to produce stronger concrete,less water is added,which makes the concrete mixture very unworkable and difficult to mix,necessitating the use of plasticizers,water reducers,superplasticizers or dispersants

## What Is Admixture Types of Admixtures
Sometimes aggregates can release gas in the concrete,and the entrained air is more than necessary,so this type of mixture is useful.Some of the most widely used detraining mixtures are tributyl phosphate,silicones,water insoluble alcohols,etc.9.AlkalineEffect of functional chemical admixtures on, SpringerLinkIn particular,two types of chemical admixtures were tested,i e,defoamer (tributyl phosphate (TBP)) and polycarboxylate superplasticizer (PS) The results indicate that the addition of TBP and PS eliminates big bubbles and promotes small non connected pores forming in matrix
