## Steel Pickling: A Profile
Steel Pickling: A Profile Draft Report Prepared for John Robson.Coking involves heating coal in the absence of air and.furnace during iron making.Sintering is the process that agglomerates fine ore particles into a porous mass for input to the blast furnace.This process was developed to make use of the coke fines,iron ore fines,and.Coal MillThe mass ratio of air to coal is dependent on the coal mill manufacturer and usually ranges from 1.75 to 2.2 with a typical value of 2.0.An air to fuel mass ratio of 1.8 produces a primary stoichiometric ratio of approximately 0.16,or 16% of the air necessary for
