## Copper indium gallium selenide solar cells
A copper indium gallium selenide solar cell (or CIGS cell,sometimes CI(G)S or CIS cell) is a thin film solar cell used to convert sunlight into electric power.It is manufactured by depositing a thin layer of copper,indium,gallium and selenium on glass or plastic backing,along with electrodes on the front and back to collect current.The Extraction of IronThe calcium silicate melts and runs down through the furnace to form a layer on top of the molten iron.It can be tapped off from time to time as slag.Slag is used in road making and as &quot;slag cement&quot; a final ground slag which can be used in cement,often

## Bioleaching technology in minerals processing
Last updated: September 2006 Bioleaching technology in minerals processing John Neale Mintek,Biotechnology Division Private Bag X3015,Randburg,2125,South Africa Bioleaching is a process that employs micro organisms to dissolve (leach) sulphide minerals.Methods of Metal Recovery by Microorganisms (2 Methods)In fact,microorganisms can be successfully used for the extraction of metals (eg,copper,zinc,cobalt,lead,uranium) from low grade or Mining with microbes is both economical and environmental friendly The term metal is used to any substance that is hard,possessing silvery lusture,and is a good conductor of heat and electricity

## 3 Technologies in Exploration,Mining,and Processing,
The life cycle of mining begins with exploration,continues through production,and ends with closure and postmining land use New technologies can benefit the mining industry and consumers in all stages of this life cycle This report does not include downstream processing,such as smelting of.Mineral Extraction The Environmental Literacy CouncilLongwall mining allows for increased mineral extraction to occur,since it shears entire blocks of mineral onto a conveyor belt through the use of self advancing,hydraulic roof supports or shields Once the mineral is extracted,the supports move on and the roof is allowed to collapse
