## Solvent Extraction &amp; Electrowinning (SX EW) Plant Design
Cerro Verde began operations in April 1977,originally formed and operated by Minero Peru,as a state run mining company.The electrowinning tankhouse was designed to produce 33,000 metric tonnes per year (mtpy) of copper cathode operating with current density of 184 amps per square meter (A m 2) and 88 percent (%) electrical current efficiency.Treatment of Mixed Sulfide Oxide Ores of CopperBeside the ores containing copper mainly as sulfide,with a small amount of oxidized copper,many of the large porphyry mines have oxide orebodies,in which the proportion of non sulfide minerals is so high that present methods of treatment are inefficient.
