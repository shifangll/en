## Best Practices for the Design and Operation of Coal Mill.
&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;Coal mill dust collectors have a substantial effect on productivity,yet have received relatively little attention as companies implement cost saving programs,like the use of petcoke as a fuel reduction measure.Petcoke is typically ground finer than coal,and it has a particularly sticky nature that makes it more difficult to clean from.Power and Energy Industry User Application Guidetaken center stage for this task.Measurement of air flow is important in controlling mill slugging,feeder runback and coal spillage.It is also a main factor in minimizing emissions and maximizing fuel response to the furnace,thus maximizing efficiency for these

## Coal mill optimisation in coal fired power.
This is all controlled by the coal mill or pulveriser,and its associated feeder equipment.Operation of the coal mill can affect the ramp rate of the power station and its ability to handle rapid changes in output.For coal fired power plants,the response time of the coal mills is critical for the overall reaction time to changing demand.Level and pressure instrumentation for energy production4 Quantity measurement on the feed belt to the coal mill To fuel the power plant boilers,chain conveyors must first bring raw coal from the bunkers.Feed belts (distributors) then transport the coal to the coal mill,where it is ground into dust and blown into the boiler.

## How coal flow is measured in thermal power plants?
Usually,in a thermal power plant it is required or most compulsory requirement to measure the flow of coal which is to be sent into the boiler (Sometimes through pulveriser mill in PC Fired Boiler).For this we used to weight the coal that is fed.Coal MillsCoal Mills are used to pulverize and dry to coal before it is blown into the power plant furnace.Operation.The coal is feed into the coal mill through a central inlet pipe where gravity is used to lead the coal to the bottom of the mill,where the grinding table and some heavy rollers

## Turndown ratio
Turndown ratio refers to the width of the operational range of a device,and is defined as the ratio of the maximum capacity to minimum capacity.For example,a device with a maximum output of 10 units and a minimum output of 2 units has a turndown ratio of 5.The term is commonly used with measurement devices and combustion plant like boilers and gasifiers
