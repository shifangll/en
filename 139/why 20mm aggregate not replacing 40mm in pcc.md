## Gravel and Chippings for Driveways,Paths and Gardens
Gravel &amp; Chippings Driveways &amp; Paths: Angular gravels graded 14 or 20mm in size are typically the most suitable for driveways as the chippings lock together when driven over,so are less likely to rut with repeated use while being too large to be caught in tyre treads.differences in concrete properties using 10mm to 20mm …Depending on the mix design,either can be used to make essentially any range of concrete strengths.When you use a smaller aggregate,such as the 10mm as your nominal coarse aggregate size,the specific surface area of the total volume of coarse aggregate is much higher than for the 20mm aggregate.

## Gradation and Size
The particle size distribution,or gradation,of an aggregate is one of the most influential aggregate characteristics in determining how it will perform as a pavement material.In HMA,gradation helps determine almost every important property including stiffness,stability,durability,permeability,workability,fatigue resistance,frictional resistance and moisture susceptibility (Roberts et.Mix Design for Pumped Concrete with PPC,OPC,OPC+FlyashConcretes without admixtures and of high cement content,(over about 460 kg m 3) are liable to prove difficult to pump,because of high friction between the concrete and the pipeline.Cement contents below 270 to 320 kg m 3 depending upon the proportion of the aggregate may also prove difficult to pump because of segregation within the pipe line.

## Sulfate attack in concrete
Sulfate attack in concrete and mortar Sulfate attack can be 'external' or 'internal'.External: due to penetration of sulfates in solution,in groundwater for example,into the concrete from outside.Internal: due to a soluble source being incorporated into the concrete at the time of mixing,gypsum in the aggregate,for example.The Effect of Aggregate Properties on ConcreteThe Effect of Aggregate Properties on Concrete Concrete is a mixture of cementious material,aggregate,and water.Aggregate is commonly considered inert filler,which accounts for 60 to 80 percent of the volume and 70 to 85 percent of the weight of concrete.
