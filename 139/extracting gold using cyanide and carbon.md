## Gold cyanidation Wikipedia
Gold cyanidation (also known as the cyanide process or the MacArthur Forrest process) is a hydrometallurgical technique for extracting gold from low grade ore by converting the gold to a water soluble coordination complexgold extraction using cyanide leaching centrostampa,Gold cyanide method is the process of dissolution of gold ore using cyanide chemicals,because every atom of gold requires dissolution of the mineral carrier or impurity with the stoichiometry of two cyanide soluble compounds
