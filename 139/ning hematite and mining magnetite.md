## Magnetite: The mineral Magnetite information and pictures
The mineral Hematite is known to form pseudomorphs over Magnetite.Such pseudomorphs are commonly known as Martite,and their appearance may be very similar to regular Magnetite.However,they differ from Magnetite in that they are only weakly attracted.HematiteHematite,also spelled as haematite,is a common iron oxide with a formula called Fe2O3 and has been widespread in rocks and soils.[5] Hematite forms in the shape of crystals through the rhombohedral lattice system,and it has the same crystal structure as ilmenite and corundum.Hematite and ilmenite form a complete solid solution at.
