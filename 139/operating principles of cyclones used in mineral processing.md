## Cyclones
Therefore operating the cyclones at high feed % solids will reduce separation efficiency and result in a coarser overflow,as the drag force is increased on each particle causing the particles to remain nearer the centre.The cyclones should ideally be operated atPrinciple of Operation of HydrocycloneThe Principle of Operation of Hydrocyclone is,in simple terms,the forces of gravity and centrifuge to separate large or heavy particles from smaller and lighter one.When sized correctly will “cut” like the ‘real cyclone’ below VS the imaginary ‘ideal’ one on the left.
