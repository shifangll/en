## Sand Particle Size Analysis
Sand Grain Analysis For those interested in the technical data of the various sand products available from The Colored Sand Company,we've put together the following tables showing average percentages found at a specific mesh size and its related measurement.Frac Sand and Proppant Size and ShapeA series of five different proppants were analyzed for size and shape distribution using the CAMSIZER.The figure below shows the size distribution using the x C min (3) descriptor (minimum of maximum chords,typically the particle width) which best correlates to sieve results.Each sample was measured twice in order to show the reproducibility.
