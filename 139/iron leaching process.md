## Gold Metallurgy and Leaching Process
Leaching,often gold,is the process of extracting a soluble constituent from a solid by means of a solvent.In extractive metallurgy,of gold,it is the process of dissolving a certain mineral (or minerals) from an ore or a concentrate,or dissolving certain constituents.Processes for phosphorus removal from iron oreAcid leaching has been considered as an alternative to flotation for removing phosphorus from iron ore.Technologically,the leaching process is a simpler way to treat the fine particle sinter feed without the restrictions that are necessary in flotation.Jin et al.

The Commercial Process Commercial metal extraction is a quicker process that can be optimized through humidity,potential hydrogen (pH),temperature,and chemical elements.The 3 most common commercial biomining processes are: 1.Slope Leaching Fine.BioleachingBut pH is the dominant factor.As soil pH increases the ferrous iron becomes ferric iron.One key factor that influences soil pH,and consequently iron levels is the process of leaching.Leaching is the process of washing away nutrients and other
