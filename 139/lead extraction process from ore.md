Extraction of zinc,the principal valuable component of the complex sulfide ores,with the simultaneous separation of lead sulfate during direct ore processing and possible accumulation of precious metals dispersed in sulfide matrix,will be probably advantageous if technical problems were resolvedZinc processing BritannicaZinc processing,the extraction of zinc from its ores and the preparation of zinc metal or chemical compounds for use in,by flotation separation In this process,the ore initially is crushed to about 19 centimetres (075 inch),combined with water,and ground to less than 01 millimetre in a ball mill,An ordinary grade of zinc.

## gcse 1 Introduction to the Extraction of Metals method,
The economics of metal extraction are not only dependent on the quality of the ore and the cost of extraction (ie richer ores lead to cheaper production),but also depend on the market price and demand If demand is high the metal price rises and may off set the price of mining lower grade ores,but if demand is low,the metal price falls and.Lead Refining Dross MetalcessMetalcess provides lead smelting and refining process and related equipment,as well as solution to,PM containing smelting slag,lead refining dross and all kinds of dust It can also treat secondary material like scrap copper,WEEE PCB IC and etc,Metalcess provides copper ore leaching,PLS solvent extraction and copper electro winning.
