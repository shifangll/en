Gold is present in refractory sulfide gold ores mainly in arsenian pyrite and arsenopyrite,where it occurs in both the chemically bonded state and as nano size grains of metallic gold.During roasting or pressure oxidation,the sulfide matrix is destroyed and essentially all the gold is converted to the metallic form.The liberated gold is readily dissolved in conventional cyanide media.Improved recovery of a low grade refractory gold ore …In sulfidic refractory gold ores,fine gold particles may be highly disseminated and locked up in sulfide minerals such as pyrite and arsenopyrite.All the largely unoxidized ores exhibit very low gold recoveries (typically &lt;20%) by direct cyanidation.

## Gold Ore
Gold ores are classified “free milling” and “refractory” based on their response to cyanide dissolution.Bioprocessing can be used to treat refractory gold bearing sulfide ores as well as carbonaceous gold ores.It is essential to characterize different types of gold ores to understand the extent and nature of gold entrapment in different associated mineral phases before an appropriate.leachability 的翻译结果 cnki翻译助手After addition of 4wt% complex adhesive,the compression strength of grained sample reached 4.0 kgf cm 2 in 24 h,the reaction between gold and NaCN solution in the oxidized ores was nearly accomplished,and the leachability of gold was up to 96%.
