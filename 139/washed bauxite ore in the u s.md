## Bauxite mining in the United States
Bauxite mining in the United States produced an estimated 128,000 metric tonnes of bauxite in 2013.[1] Although the United States was an important source of bauxite in the early 20th century,it now supplies less than one percent of world bauxite production.The Bauxite IndexThe bauxite is then mined using excavators or loaders.Off road haul trucks transported the bauxite to the crusher.Several pits are usually mined simultaneously in order to supply the refinery with a consistent grade of ore.
