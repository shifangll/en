## Cast irons
Cast Irons Miguel Angel Yescas Gonzalez and H.K.D.H.Bhadeshia Cast irons typically contain 4 wt% of carbon with a high silicon concentrations and a greater concentration of impurities than steels.The carbon equivalent (CE) of a cast iron helps to distinguish the grey irons which cool into a microstructure containing graphite and and the white irons where the carbon is present mainly as.Effect Of Basic Chemical Element In Sgi (Ductile Iron)Why magnesium: Research work has shown that on a laboratory scale additions of a number of elements are capable of producing spheroidal graphite structures in the cast irons.These elements include magnesium,cerium,calcium and yttrium.However.

## A Possible Mechanism for the Formation of Exploded,
In hypereutectic nodular cast irons,primary precipitation of graphite may lead to graphite flotation in thick section castings Graphite degeneracy such as so called exploded graphite is then often associated with this flotation phenomenon and it appears as precipitates where the nodular form is replaced by star like or flower like shape It has been reported that exploded graphite develops.Is graphite dust explosiveOnly if mixed with a suitable oxidiser,most notably the air.thus a fine dispersion of graphite in the air can be ignited with explosive violence.Also whats known as &quot;graphitic oxide&quot; is.
