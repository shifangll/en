The sulfate ion,SO4,is the form primarily absorbed by plants Sulfate is soluble and is easily lost from soils by leaching As sulfate is leached down into soil,it accumulates in heavier (higher clay content) subsoils For this reason,testing for sulfur in topsoil is unreliable for predicting sulfur availability during a long growing seasonCalcium Sulfate Baking Ingredients BAKERpediaCalcium sulfate is used mainly in the production of bread,and in the fortification of bread flour,cookies,brownies and breads When using calcium sulfate some consideration must be taken into account: 2,4 As a flour bleaching agent: it is mixed with benzoyl peroxide at a ratio of no more than 6:1 by weight
