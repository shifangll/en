## Bond Work Index (Energy equation) Grinding,
The Bond Work Index is a factor that measures the energy consumed in size reduction operation of the ore The Bond's Work Index equation is: W=WI* (10 √P80 10 √F80) where W= the energy input (Work input) per ton,kwh metric ton WI= Work Index= specific energy per ton,kwh metric ton (characterizes the ore)Bond Work Index (Energy equation) Grinding,Bond Work Index (Energy equation) Grinding & Classification Circuits Metallurgist & Mineral Processing Engineer

## Covariance Formula Examples How To Calculate Correlation?
Covariance Formula Example #2 The given table describes the rate of economic growth(x i) and the rate of return(y i) on the S&P 500 With the help of the covariance formula,determine whether economic growth and S&P 500 returns have a positive or inverse relationship Calculate the mean value of x,and y as wellAMIT 135: Lesson 7 Ball Mills & Circuits Mining Mill,Mill Type Overview Three types of mill design are common The Overflow Discharge mill is best suited for fine grinding to 75 106 microns; The Diaphram or Grate Discharge mill keeps coarse particles within the mill for additional grinding and typically used for grinds to 150 250 microns; The Center Periphery Discharge mill has feed reporting from both ends and the product,
