## Jet mill
A jet mill grinds materials by using a high speed jet of compressed air or inert gas to impact particles into each other.Jet mills can be designed to output particles below a certain size,while continue milling particles above that size,resulting in a narrow size distribution of the resulting product.Particles leaving the mill can be separated from the gas stream by cyclonic separation.
