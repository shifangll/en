## Hardgrove Grindability Tester
Hardgrove Grindability Tester measures relative ease of pulverization of coals compared to standard coals in accordance with ASTM D409 Hardgrove Machine Method.The resulting Hardgrove Grindability Index (HGI) provides a measure of energy required in a grinding process or a measure of yield for a given energy input.hgi coal crusherhardgrove coal grinder:The Hardgrove Grindability Index HGI is a measure of coal’s resistance to crushing Grinding studies and the resulting HGI allow many different types of coal users to evaluate how coals will perform in their mills allowing them to estimate
