## The mechanism of leaching of gold from refractory ores
Abstract Refractory gold ores commonly contain free gold,submicroscopic gold,base metal sulphides,pyrite,pyrrhorite,labile sulphides and carbonaceous material.The analysis of gold deportment with the diagnostic leaching technique has opened a research field.Metallurgist &amp; Mineral Processing EngineerRefractory ores are normally have either a high sulfide content that masks the gold preventing cyanide leaching of the gold,or high organic content that also block gold leaching (reabsorbs the gold),or it can have a high clay content that also soaks up the cyanide.

Diagnostic leaching tests were also performed to shed light on the refractory characteristics of ore.The leaching tests show that the extraction of gold and silver is consistently low,i.e.≤47% and ≤19.2%,respectively,over a leaching period of 24 h.Even fineNew Applications of Diagnostic LeachingAs an alternate way to identify gold associations in ores,the diagnostic leaching technique was first developed in South Africa in 1986 (Tumilty,1986),and is now widely used to provide a good indication of gold deportation in its various occurrence phases.
