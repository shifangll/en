About Our Company Professional mining equipment manufacturers determine fineness of cement experiment by blain air Air permeability specific surface ore crusher priceThe air permeability specific surface of a powder material is a single parameter measurement of the fineness of the powder Blaine method This was developed determine fineness of cement experiment,Initial and Final Setting time of Cement Effects How,Factors that affect initial and final setting time of cement: The fineness of cement,the presence of salts in sand,atmospheric conditions For example,cement requires a temperature of 27&#176;c to complete Hydration,during winters the climate is low which stops the hydration and takes a longer time to set harden

## How Does the Ratio of Sand to Cement Affect the Strength,
Experimental Procedure Using 2 × 4 lumber and plywood,make a form for concrete bricks Each brick should be the same size,eg,4 × 4 × 20 cm Use plywood for the bottom of the form,and 2 × 4 lumber for the sides and endsTesting for the Fineness of Cement and it's Significant,The following proportions are usually maintained in Cement: About 10% of the cement of fine particles is smaller than 2 &#181;m,10% of wt of cement is made of particles larger than 50 &#181;m,and only a few wt% is particles larger than 90 &#181;m Fineness test of Cement
