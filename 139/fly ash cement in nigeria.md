## Fly ash
Fly ash material solidifies while suspended in the exhaust gases and is collected by electrostatic precipitators or filter bags.Since the particles solidify rapidly while suspended in the exhaust gases,fly ash particles are generally spherical in shape and range in size from 0.5 &#181;m to 300 &#181;m.The major consequence of the rapid cooling is.FLY ASH IN CONCRETEFly Ash is additive that is substituted for Portland Cement.It lowers cost,increases long term strength,increases the working time for installation in hot weather and reduces ASR problems.There have been concerns expressed about coating concrete surfaces
