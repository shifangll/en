## Is that true that gold can't be dissolved by any acid?
Yes,gold cannot be dissolved by any single acid.This occurs because as per reactivity series,gold is less reactive than hydrogen.Thus,because gold cannot displace hydrogen from the acid,it cannot be corroded dissolved.However,a mixture of.What chemical can dissolve gold? AnswersDriveGold is unaffected by air,water,alkalis and all acids except aqua regia (a mixture of hydrochloric acid and nitric acid) which can dissolve gold.Gold does react with halogens.It will,for example,react very slowly with chlorine gas at room temperature to form gold
