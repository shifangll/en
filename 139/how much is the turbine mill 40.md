## Wind power in Iowa
From October 23 to 24,2017,wind power provided all the power consumed by MidAmerica Energy's Iowa customers.This was the first time wind generation reached this threshold,aided by sustained winds of 25 mph (40 km h) with gusts to 40 mph (65 km h).How much do wind turbines cost?A 10 kilowatt machine (the size needed to power a large home) might have an installed cost of $50,000 $80,000 (or more).Wind turbines have significant economies of scale.Smaller farm or residential scale turbines cost less overall,but are more expensive per kilowatt of energy producing capacity.

## Wind Energy Math Calculations
Wind Energy Math Calculations Measuring the Swept Area of Your Wind Turbine Why is This Important??? You will need to know the swept area of your wind turbine to calculate the total power in the wind that hits your turbine.Remember the Power In The Wind Equation:Head Milling 101: The Basics of Head Milling to Gain.&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;The reason is simple: The more you squeeze the air and fuel mixture in the combustion chamber,the more power you can create.In theory,forcing air and fuel in as small a combustion chamber as possible (measured in volume) will yield maximum engine compression and horsepower.
