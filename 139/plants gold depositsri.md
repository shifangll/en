## How to Identify a Gold Bearing Area Sciencing
Gold is mainly found in two types of deposits: lode (hard rock veins) and placer (surface).Locating the richest gold bearing areas primarily involves research,planning,dedication and funds.In other words,those who study geological surveys,land formations,rock structures and gold prospecting history prior to prospecting may have a better chance of finding desired amounts of gold.List Minerals Associated with GoldTo know what type of rock is gold associated with you must see that the minerals most common in placer deposits are platinum,iridosmine,magnetite,iron pyrites,ilmenite,zircon,garnets,rutile and barytes; wolfram,scheelite,brookite and diamonds are less common.Diamonds are associated with gold in Brazil,and also occasionally in the Urals and in the United States.In auriferous quartz.
