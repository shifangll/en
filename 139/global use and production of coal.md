## Global use and production of coal
In the Statistical Review of World Energy,we note that 2018 saw a further bounce back in coal building on the slight pickup seen in the previous year with both consumption (1.4%) and production (4.3%) increasing at their fastest rates for five years.This strength was concentrated in Asia,with India and China together accounting for the vast majority of the gains in both consumption.Animated Maps: Fossil Fuel Production by CountryAfter the U.S.and Russia,it’s a fairly steep dropoff in terms of natural gas production.Countries like Iran,Canada,Qatar,and China are the next most significant players,but they each only produce 6% of the global total.Coal Production Coal use may be on

## Coal Production
Coal production dates back to the earliest civilizations cited by Aristotle (340) and Agricola (1556) for use in fire combustion during the middle of the fourth century B.C.(Landis &amp; Weaver,1993).It was thought that the Chinese first commercialized coal productionCoal for cement: Present and future trends18&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Taking the above into account,the IEA expects global coal demand to grow by 0.4% yr and account for 30% of global electricity production by 2040.Although coal consumption is expected to grow slowly for the foreseeable future,growth will be unevenly distributed.
