## Magnetite Market Size,Share
Magnetite Market size is expecting surge in demand over the forecasted period owing to its wide usage in steel making and various industries.It is a mineral and one of the main iron ore used as catalyst for industrial synthesis of ammonia.Product even occurs in sedimentary rocks,lake and marine sediments,due to its high iron content its usage in blast furnaces and steel conversion has.I dont see any Magnetite! :: Creativerse Tips &amp; StrategiesI have everything except Magnetite and this is pretty frustrating cuz I need to mine with stone mining cells.I found more then 50 obsidian ores already melted to obsidian but only 1!!! magnetite,any good tips? I have found way more coal and obsidian but.
