## Gold extraction
Gold extraction refers to the processes required to extract gold from its ores.This may require a combination of comminution,mineral processing,hydrometallurgical,and pyrometallurgical processes to be performed on the ore.[1] Gold mining from alluvium ores was once achieved by techniques associated with placer mining such as simple gold panning and sluicing,resulting in direct recovery …GOLD RECOVERY FROM PRINTED CIRCUIT BOARDS OF MOBILE …Gold Recovery from Printed Circuit Boards of Mobile Phones Scraps Using a Leaching Solution Alternative to Cyanide 933 From a literature review (leaching of gold ores,mostly),it was found that there are two research lines.
