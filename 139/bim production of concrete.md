## Modernisation,Mechanisation and Industrialisation of …
Description Modernisation,Mechanisation and Industrialisation of Concrete Structures discusses the manufacture of high quality prefabricated concrete construction components,and how that can be achieved through the application of developments in concrete technology,information modelling and best practice in design and manufacturing techniques.How quickly is concrete adopting BIM? BIM+BIM’s relationship with concrete to date is a tale of two halves.While BIM use on reinforced concrete frame projects has been limited,as CM’s research with Trimble shows,the precast sector is quickly discovering the technology’s benefits.

## Energy Consumption in Production of Concrete
The production of 1 m&#179; of concrete requires 2,775 MJ of energy.This energy comes mostly from oil burning,which generates CO2.2.775 MJ of energy is produced by 0.37 barrels of oil.Saving concrete,e.g.by adopting appropriate building solutions,meansCorrosion protection of reinforced concrete Planning,…Despite the unusually extreme conditions,the report’s authors conclude that the CALTITE concrete is likely to deliver an additional “few decades” service‐life while the non‐Caltite concrete is “already nearing the end of its useable service‐life” after only 15 years.
