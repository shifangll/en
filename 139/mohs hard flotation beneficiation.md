## Beneficiation of Iron Ores IspatGuru
Flotation to be used all alone as a beneficiation method is used rarely.Chemical reagents used are mainly of three main groups namely (i) collectors amines,(ii) frothers,and (iii) antifoams.Reagents may be added in a number of forms which include solid,immiscible liquid emulsion and solution in water.Froth flotationFroth flotation is a process for selectively separating hydrophobic materials from hydrophilic.This is used in mineral processing,paper recycling and waste water treatment industries.Historically this was first used in the mining industry,where it was one of the great enabling technologies of the 20th century.It has been described as &quot;the.
