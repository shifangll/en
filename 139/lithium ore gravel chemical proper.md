Is separating sand from gravel chemical or physical change? Wiki User Septem 4:56AM i understand where you are coming from.i will give you two different answers.Lithium Geoscience AustraliaLithium resources occur in two distinct categories: lithium minerals,largely from the mineral spodumene (Li 2 O.Al 2 O 3.4SiO 2),and salts,largely from lithium rich brines in salt lakes.Canada,China and Australia have significant resources of lithium minerals,while lithium brine is produced predominantly in Chile,followed by Argentina,China and the USA.

Copper processing is a complicated process that begins with mining of the ore (less than 1% copper) and ends with sheets of 99.99% pure copper called cathodes,which will ultimately be made into products for everyday use.The most common types of ore,copper oxide and copper sulfide,undergo two different processes,hydrometallurgy and pyrometallurgy,respectively,due to the different.Alkali metalThe new product exhibited chemical properties of an alkali metal (such as coprecipitating with caesium salts),which led Perey to believe that it was element 87,caused by the alpha decay of actinium.Perey then attempted to determine the proportion of
