## The Pelleting Process
The pelleting process starts with a bin (Figure 1,Item 1) in which the mixture of mash is stored.From there,the mash will flow by gravity into the pellet mill (Figure 1,Item 2).This machine is usually located on the ground or main work floor level.The (FigureElectrical discharge machiningElectrical discharge machining is a machining method primarily used for hard metals or those that would be very difficult to machine with traditional techniques.EDM typically works with materials that are electrically conductive,although methods have also been.
