This is an alternative view to recent control strategies that use froth properties (Bartolacci et al.2005; Morar et al.2006).An argument in favour of this position is the metallurgical success of gas velocity profiling (distributing the air in an organized way down a bank of cells) which emphasizes managing the gas dispersion&nbsp;.Froth Flotation Definition of Froth Flotation by Merriam …Froth flotation definition is flotation in which air bubbles are introduced into a mixture of finely divided ore or other material with water and a chemical that aids attachment of the bubbles to the particles of the desired material and its recovery as a froth.
