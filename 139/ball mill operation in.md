## What is a ball mill? What are its uses and advantages?
&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;Ball Mill The rotation of the Ball mill causes the charge consisting of grinding media (steel balls) and feed material to be lifted due to centrifugal forces and friction between the media and the lining.The height to which the charge is lifted d.Optimization of mill performance by usingabout the mill operation is vital.An innovative tool which can deliver information about in mill dynamics has been developed by Magotteaux.It can provide online and accurate measurements of the degree of grinding ball fil
