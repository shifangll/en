## The Definitive Guide to Data Mining.Purpose,Examples,…
What is Data Mining? What are the most effective data mining techniques? Check out our blog to know more.We live in the age of massive data production.If you think about it pretty much every gadget or service we are using creates a lot of information (for example,Facebook processes around 500+ terabytes of data each day).Data Mining: An OverviewData Mining Algorithms “A data mining algorithm is a well defined procedure that takes data as input and produces output in the form of models or patterns” “well defined”: can be encoded in software “algorithm”: must terminate after some finite number of steps
