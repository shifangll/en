(Cross post from r.A hard grinding disc stone would be even worse.causing increased potential for unwanted material removal and accidental gauging.I've been using fiber back sanding discs for years (again,rarely on hot rolled) and have success.but I seem to go through a lot of discs when bringing it against the mill scale.

## Getting intense about grinding
When slurry is pumped from the bottom,it travels through the grinding discs to the top of the mill,wearing finer and finer through contact with the media.Counter discs attached to the shell liner block particles from bypassing the grinding discs,while holes in the discs let the finest particles pass through without further attrition.Wet grinding of coal in the Szego Mill (Conference) OSTI.GOVAbstract.New results from a systematic grinding study with the larger,SM 320 Szego Mill are reported.A wide range of flow rates,from 750 to 5300 kg h of coal,at 60 65% solids concentration has been covered,with both single and multiple passes through the mill.
