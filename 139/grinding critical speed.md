## How can I determine the best RPM for Dry Ball Milling machine
Critical speed (in rpm) = 42.3 sqrt(D d) with D the diameter of the mill in meters and d the diameter of the largest grinding ball you will use for experiment (also expressed in meters).Then again,a aracting motion produces a coarser grind.If you want your grind to be finer,it is the cascading motion that is your best choice&nbspBall millThe ball mill is used for grinding materials such as coal,pigments,and feldspar for pottery.Grinding can be carried out either wet or dry but the former is performed at low speed.Blending of explosives is an example of an application for rubber balls.
