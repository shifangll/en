## Implementation Of Quality Management System For Coal.
In the thermal power plants maximum requirements of fuel is a coal.Coal handling plant (CHP) is the main and major key system to transfer ton of coal fuel to the boiler plant.The handling of this fuel is a great job.The coal has to size,processed,and handled which should be done effectively and efficiently.Because of this CHP managementThermal Power Plant Working INDIAN POWER SECTORA coal based thermal power plant converts the chemical energy of the coal into electrical energy.This is achieved by raising the steam in the boilers,expanding it through the turbine and coupling the turbines to the generators which converts mechanical energy into electrical energy.
