## Concrete
Concrete is a composite material composed of fine and coarse aggregate bonded together with a fluid cement (cement paste) that hardens (cures) over time.In the past limebased cement binders were often used,such as lime putty,but sometimes with other hydraulic cements,such as a calcium aluminate cement or with Portland cement to form Portland cement concrete (for its visual resemblance to.Portland Cement AssociationCuring plays an important role on strength development and durability of concrete.Curing takes place immediately after concrete placing and finishing,and involves maintenance of desired moisture and temperature conditions,both at depth and near the surface,for.
