## What Are the Uses of Coal? Reference
According to the World Coal Association,the primary uses of coal are in electricity generation,the creation of liquid fuel,the production of steel and cement manufacturing There are two primary types of coal,thermal coal and metallurgical coal Thermal coal goes into fuel and electricity.Q&amp;A: Why cement emissions matter for climate change …If the cement industry were a country,it would be the third largest emitter in the world.In 2015,it generated around 2.8bn tonnes of CO2,equivalent to 8% of the global total a greater share than any country other than China or the US.Cement use is set to rise as.

## Carbon Dioxide Emission Factors for Coal
Coal is an important source of energy in the United States,and the Nation's reliance on this fossil fuel for electricity generation is growing The combustion of coal,however,adds a significant amount of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere per unit of heat energy,more than does the combustion of other fossil fuelsCoal University of Colorado BoulderThe paper,brick,limestone,and cement industries all use coal to make their products Contrary to what many people think,coal is no longer a major energy source for heating American homes or other buildings
