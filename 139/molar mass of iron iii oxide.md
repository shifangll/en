&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;Over the years,the thermite reaction has been used for welding railroad rails,in incendiary bombs,and to ignite solid fuel rocket motors.The reaction is given below.Fe2O3(s) + 2 Al(s) 2 Fe(l) + Al2O3(s) What masses of iron(III) oxide and aluminum must be used.What is the molar mass of iron (III) oxide (Fe2O3,What is the molar mass of iron (III) oxide (Fe2O3)? Click to rate this post! Here are 2 iron atoms,so the atomic mass has to be multiplied by 2,which gives you a value of 1117 g mol 3 oxygen atoms are there,so you would multiply the atomic mass of O by 3 to obtain an atomic weight of 4800 g mol Add the mass of each atom together to.
