## What is cement reconciliation?
Cement reconciliation is more than tallying of total cement received and total cement issued.Where ever cement is used,be it in concrete,plastering,tiling,waterproofing etc it has got a agreed standard per unit consumption,any thing above this.Treatment of Waste generated from Cement Industry and their …produce cement using dry process (approx.96%) and very few use the wet and semi dry process.Most of the unit produces Portland cement while very few are involved in white cement.Health effects of Cement Dust The dust generated from cement plant could

## Construction Waste
Construction waste is defined as relatively clean,heterogeneous building materials generated from the various construction activities (Tchobanoglous et al.1993).Possible sources of generating construction waste can be classified under six main categories (Al Ansary et al.2004a; Gavilan,1994),namely: design source,procurement source,handling of materials source,operation source.Yield Problems and Waste Allowance Concrete …Q.: We delivered concrete to a poured wall contractor building residential foundations in a subdivision.He says we shorted him about 1 4 yard per yard load.I ran a unit weight test on the fresh concrete and divided the total batch weight by the unit weight.The yield.
