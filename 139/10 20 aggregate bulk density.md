Void Content Calculate the void content in the aggregate using the bulk density as follows: Where: 3M=bulk density aggregate,lb ft (kg m3) S=bulk specific gravity (dry basis) as determined in accordance with KT 6; and W=density of water as established in Table 1 in KT 15,Section 54 9 REPORT Record to the nearest 50 g,01 lb or 01% of.Bulk Density Measurement Fact Sheets soilqualityorgauIf soil has &gt;10 % gravel or the stones are &gt;2 cm conventional bulk density readings will be inaccurate,as most coarse fragments have bulk densities of 22 30 g cm 3 (McKenzie et al,2002) This is important to recognise when using bulk density measurements to calculate nutrient levels on an area basis,as an over estimation will occur
