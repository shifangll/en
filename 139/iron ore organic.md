## Iron ore pelletizing systems
Iron Ore Pellets are formed from beneficiated or run of mine iron fines.The iron is usually ground to a very fine level and mixed with limestone or dolomite as a fluxing agent and bentonite or organic binders as a binding agent.Different Types of Iron OreIron formation consists of iron ore such as siderite,magnetite,and hematite,with silica in the form of chert,jasper,etc.generally in bands,but sometimes not distinctly so.The bands of iron ore are at times high grade,but are often mixed with a good deal of silica,the whole making an ore too lean for use without concentration.
