Until the 1950s of the last century,the oxidized iron ores that were loaded into the blast furnace had granulometries within 10 and 120 mm.However,the depletion of high grade iron ore sources has made necessary the utilization of concentration processes with the purpose of enriching the iron ore.Because of these processes,a fine granulometry is produced,and thus iron agglomeration.Symposium on Iron Ore Pelletizing (Sep 2018),…8 people interested.Rated 5.0 by 1 person.Check out who is attending exhibiting speaking schedule &amp; agenda reviews timing entry ticket fees.2018 edition of Symposium on Iron Ore Pelletizing will be held at H&#244;tel Ch&#226;teau Laurier Qu&#233;bec,Qu&#233;bec starting on 30th September.It is a 4 day event organised by COREM and will conclude on 03 Oct 2018.
