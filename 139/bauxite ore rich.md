## Bauxite
Bauxite is an aluminum rich sedimentary rock.It is the principal ore of aluminum.Aluminum in bauxite is hosted by aluminum hydroxide minerals,mostly gibbsite 4.The major impurities are iron oxides and hydroxides (which give reddish color to most bauxites) and.EGA's Aluminium ProductsDeposits of bauxite tend to be found in tropical areas where it is formed through the weathering of aluminium rich rocks over millions of years.The largest concentration of high quality bauxite is found in the north west of the Republic of Guinea.

## Bauxite
Bauxite is a heterogeneous,naturally occurring material of varying composition that is relatively rich in aluminium.The principal minerals in bauxite are gibbsite (Al 2 O 3.3H 2 O),boehmite (Al 2 O 3.H 2 O) and diaspore,which has the same composition as boehmite,but is denser and harder.Bauxite websiteRich in alkali soluble aluminous minerals,bauxite is the ore that feeds the Bayer process to produce alumina (Al2O3),from which aluminium metal is won by the Hall Herault process of electrolytic smelting.
