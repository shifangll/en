## Viscosity
The viscosity of a fluid is a measure of its resistance to deformation at a given rate.For liquids,it corresponds to the informal concept of &quot;thickness&quot;: for example,syrup has a higher viscosity than water.Viscosity can be conceptualized as quantifying the frictional force that arises between adjacent layers of fluid that are in relative motion.For instance,when a fluiMathematical Problems in EngineeringMathematical Problems in Engineering is a peer reviewed,Open Access journal that publishes results of rigorous engineering research carried out using mathematical tools.Contributions containing formulations or re

## Thermal Decomposition of Coal
The thermal decomposition of coal by slow heating rate is generally used to investigate carbonization of bituminous coal for coke making.It means that the thermal decomposition of coal under non oxidizing conditions produces a residue (coke),which consists of carbon and mineral matter.During this process the coal passes through several stages.Long term electricity load forecasting: Current and future.Decomposition on sectoral levels allows the use of sector specific drivers for the long term electricity load,including the technological drivers (see Section 2.2).Such bottom up decomposition is pursued in e.g.Bo&#223;mann and Staffell (2015),Lindberg et al.(2016a) a

## The Research Progress of High Efficiency Energy Saving …
Abstract: The paper research the loading methods of medium speed coal mill and the variable loading system of LM18.20 coal mill.The experiment result has shown that using variable hydraulic loading system can make the coal mill running steadily with stable.GunpowderGunpowder,also known as black powder to distinguish it from modern smokeless powder,is the earliest known chemical explosive.It consists of a mixture of sulfur (S),charcoal (C),and potassium nitrate (saltpeter,KNO 3).The sulfur and charcoal act as fuels while the saltpeter is an oxidizer.
