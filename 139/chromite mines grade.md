## Chromite: from the mineral to the commodity
Abstract Abstract Chromite belongs to the spinel group with the general chemical formula XY 2 O 4,where X and Y represent divalent and trivalent metal ions,respectively.Four types of chromite ore deposits occur as either lode or secondary deposits.Lode.Extraction of Chromium from Chromite Ore20 07 2017&#0183;&#32;Refractory grade chromite ores contained a minimum of 20 pct Al2O3 and more than 60 pct Al2O3 plus Cr2O3 Primary chromium needs for all uses in the United States by the year 2000 are estimated to be nearly three times its present annual consumption (400,000 short tons),and world needs in the year 2000 are estimated to be nearly 4 times that of the United Stat
