## Milling Process,Defects,Equipment
Milling is the most common form of machining,a material removal process,which can create a variety of features on a part by cutting away the unwanted material.The milling process requires a milling machine,workpiece,fixture,and cutter.The Pelleting ProcessThe pelleting process starts with a bin (Figure 1,Item 1) in which the mixture of mash is stored.From there,the mash will flow by gravity into the pellet mill (Figure 1,Item 2).This machine is usually located on the ground or main work floor level.The (Figure.
