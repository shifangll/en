## Heap leaching
Heap leaching is an industrial mining process used to extract precious metals,copper,uranium,and other compounds from ore using a series of chemical reactions that absorb specific minerals and re separate them after their division from other earth materials.Metallurgist &amp; Mineral Processing EngineerYou can try multipoint cyanide control suggest tank 1,3 and 5 but remember you do need residual cyanide to not influence the gold loading kinetics in the system,tails cyanide levels of 100 is not bad.Do you have copper in the ore?
