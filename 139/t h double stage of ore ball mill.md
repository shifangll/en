## Ball Mill
Ball mills tumble iron or steel balls with the ore.The balls are initially 5 10 cm diameter but gradually wear away as grinding of the ore proceeds.The feed to ball mills (dry basis) is typically 75 vol. % ore and 25% steel.The ball mill is operated in closed circuit with a particle size measurement device and size control cyclones.Selection of Comminution Circuits for Improved EfficiencyThe benchmark circuit varies with plant capacity and ore competency: â€¢ Single stage crush single stage SAG mills and two stage crush ball mill circuits are typically selected for low throughput plants (&lt;50 t h) where personnel costs are a large component of costs.â€¢ â€¦
