The densities of rocks and minerals are normally expressed as specific gravity,which is the density of the rock relative to the density of water.This isn't as complex as you may think because water's density is 1 gram per cubic centimeter or 1 g cm 3.Therefore.Making Minerals How Growing Rocks Can Help Reduce …there is more surface area on the crushed rocks for the carbon to form minerals.However,there is not nearly as much rock that can be mineralized on the surface as there is underground,so the overall amount of carbon storage is higher for Likely the.
