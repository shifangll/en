## Binder (material)
Physical properties Some materials labeled as binders such as cement have a high compressive strength but low tensile strength and need to be reinforced with fibrous material or rebar if tension and shear forces will be applied.Other binding agents such as resins may be tough and possibly elastic but can neither bear compressive nor tensile force.Building materialsRoad construction with limestone powder (filler) Road building Projects without limestone powder (filler) is scarcely unthinkable.Roads have to show a lasting stability.They have to withstand frost and other weather factors.The upper area of a road crust consists of
