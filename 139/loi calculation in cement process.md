## Questions and Answers
Sir,What exactly is recarbonation in cement process and where it is likely to happen.How do we know that it is happening and the effects of the same on process or production.We are having a peculiar observation now a days in the preheater of our kiln.Re: Raw meal to clinker ratio&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;Re: Raw meal to clinker ratio Hello Arvind,The calculations assume that are measuring the feed rate of kiln feed which already contains the recirculation dust.ie in the situation where you are adding the recirculating dust to the fresh raw meal in the kiln feed bin,with the kiln feed weigher located after the kiln feed bin.
