## Eliminating Copper from Gold Ore
When reviewing Methods of Eliminating Copper from Gold Ores we see that several methods have been suggested to eliminate copper from ores prior to cyanidation.Preliminary extraction of the copper with sulphuric or sulphurous acids may be applicable to ores containing oxidized copper minerals such as malachite,azurite and chrysocolla but these acids have but little effect on sulphide copper.Innovations: Introduction to Copper: Mining & ExtractionCopper minerals and ores are found in both igneous and sedimentary rocks.Mining of copper ores is carried out using one of two methods.Copper is found in the earth.
