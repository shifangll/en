## copper extraction and purification
Electrolytic refining The purification uses an electrolyte of copper(II) sulphate solution,impure copper anodes,and strips of high purity copper for the cathodes.The diagram shows a very simplified view of a cell.At the cathode,copper(II) ions are deposited asFrom Ore to Finished ProductFrom its original home buried underground in a mine to its use in a finished product such as wire or pipe,copper passes through a number of stages.When it is recycled it …

## Copper Mining and Processing: Processing of Copper Ores …
Copper processing is a complicated process that begins with mining of the ore (less than 1% copper) and ends with sheets of 99.99% pure copper called cathodes,which will ultimately be made into products for everyday use.The most common types of ore,copper oxide and copper sulfide,undergo two different processes,hydrometallurgy and pyrometallurgy,respectively,due to the different.Electrolytic RefiningElectrolytic Refining of Copper Here we will take an example of electrolytic copper refining to understand the process more clearly.Copper is usually mined from its coal known as blister copper.It is about 98 to 99 per cent pure.

## Purification or Refining of Impure Metals
We shall understand electrolytic refining of metals by taking the example of refining of copper.In case of copper,a thick block of impure copper is made anode and a thin block of pure metal is made cathode and copper sulphate solution is used as an electrolyte.Refining of Metals: Distillation,Zone Refining,…Copper refining is done by the electrolytic process.Its impurities of iron and zinc will dissolve in the copper sulphate solution.And its other impurities of gold or silver or platinum will remain behind.Zone Refining Zone refining is a special method we use to purify
