## Tungsten carbide
Tungsten carbide (chemical formula: WC) is a chemical compound (specifically,a carbide) containing equal parts of tungsten and carbon atoms.In its most basic form,tungsten carbide is a fine gray powder,but it can be pressed and formed into shapes through a process called sintering for use in industrial machinery,cutting tools,abrasives.Nonferrous Metal Standards and Nonferrous Alloy …ASTM's nonferrous metals and alloys standards are instrumental in specifying,testing,and evaluating nonferrous metals and alloys (excluding copper) and light metals and alloys and refractory metals.These standards have,and continue to play,a preeminent role.

Tungsten is a hard,heavy and rare metal found naturally in the earth's crust.It was first identified as an element in 1781 and later as a metal in 1783.Mined tungsten ore is ground into a fine powder,at which point it is considered pure tungsten metal.The powder is.TUNGSTENOpen Pit Mining Most active tungsten mines are of moderate scale (production of a few 100,000t of oore per year),and thus the few operations that use open pit mining techniques are of a much sma ller scale than for example copper or iron ore mines Currently
