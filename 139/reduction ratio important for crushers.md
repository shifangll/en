## Jaw Crusher
Inversely,at a given reduction ratio,effective streamlining could increase the capacity by 30%. The typical reduction ratio is bound to be between 6 and 8 and is similar that of jaw equipment. Applying the crushing force by rolling the nut breaks flats and gives a product that is more “cubic” than the jaw crusher…Crushing McLanahanBecause each crusher type has a limited reduction capability,sometimes several stages of crushing are needed to achieve the desired final product size.Primary crushers are important for kicking off production and initial product sizing for further processing.They receive the material directly from the blasting,drilling or dredging process.
