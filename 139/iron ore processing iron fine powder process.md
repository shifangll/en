## Mineral processing
Sizing is the general term for separation of particles according to their size.The simplest sizing process is screening,or passing the particles to be sized through a screen or number of screens.Screening equipment can include grizzlies,bar screens,wedge wire screens,radial sieves,banana screens,multi deck screens,vibratory screen,fine screens,flip flop screens and wire mesh screens.Iron ore pelletizing systemsIron ore can be upgraded to a higher iron ore content through beneficiation.This process generates iron ore filter cake which needs to be pelletized to be used in the steel making process.Also during the processing of high grade iron ores which don’t need beneficiated,fines which are generated can be pelletized and used instead of being disposed of.

## Different Types of Iron Ore
Iron formation consists of iron ore such as siderite,magnetite,and hematite,with silica in the form of chert,jasper,etc.generally in bands,but sometimes not distinctly so.The bands of iron ore are at times high grade,but are often mixed with a good deal of silica,the whole making an ore too lean for use without concentration.Iron Ore ScienceDirectMining of iron ore is a highly capital and energy intensive process.Life cycle assessment (LCA) of the mining and mineral processing of iron ore in Australia was carried out in this chapter using SimaPro LCA software as a case study.
