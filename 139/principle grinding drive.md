2020 2 28&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;In all ore dressing and milling Operations,including flotation,cyanidation,gravity concentration,and amalgamation,the Working Principle is to crush and grind,often with rob mill &amp; ball mills,the ore in order to liberate the minerals.In the chemical and process industries,grinding is an important step in preparing raw materials for subsequent treatment.Current issues on high power cycloconverter Fed gearless motor.Looking at economy of scale,new projects consider the use of big mill grinding circuits,where larger power gearless motor drives with cycloconverters in the range around 20 MW are being applied for semiautogenous (SAG) mills and recently,ball mills are also being considered.This work addresses some current issues&nbsp;.
