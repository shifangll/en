## Soil Compaction Test in 4 Steps: Learn With the Ultimate,
Sand Cone Test: A Sand Cone Test is an inexpensive method of Soil Compaction Testing and is fairly accurate if conducted correctly The most important variable to consider is that the sand is consistently dry throughout the testing Any change in moisture content will skew the results To begin,a small hole is dug in the compacted soilDETERMINATION OF FIELD DENSITY OF SOIL BY SAND …Determination of field density of cohesion less soil is not possible by core cutter method,because it is not possible to obtain a core sample.In such situation,the sand replacement method is employed to determine the unit weight.
