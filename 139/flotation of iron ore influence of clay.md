## Managing clay minerals in froth flotation—A critical …
Clay minerals are widely present in various ore deposits as gangue minerals.The processing of high clay content ores is becoming a significant challenge for the mining industry owing to the poor flotation performance caused by the presence of clay minerals.Role of silica and alumina content in the flotation of iron …Flotation response of iron ore depends on its impurities.• Silica rich ores float better compared to alumina rich ores.• Clay and gibbsite coat on hematite and hinder flotation.• SEM studies support less coating of quartz due to coarser size.• Silica in the form of

## Froth Flotation of Iron Ores
With the depleting reserves of high grade iron ore in the world,froth flotation has become increasingly important to process intermediate and low grade iron ore in an attempt to meet the rapidly growing demand on the international market.In over half a century’s.Effect &amp; Influence of Flocculants &amp; Surfactants on …Experiments were conducted with the addition of several types of flocculants and surfactants.The filtration response of the slurries was studied in terms of the cake formation rate and the residual cake moisture.An analysis of the results is presented in ascertaining the role of flocculants and surfactants during filtration A specular hematite concentrate (67% Fe,0.5% SiO2) wet ground to.
