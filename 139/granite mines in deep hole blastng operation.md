## Drilling
Drilling is a cutting process that uses a drill bit to cut a hole of circular cross section in solid materials.The drill bit is usually a rotary cutting tool,often multi point.The bit is pressed against the work piece and rotated at rates from hundreds to thousands of revolutions per minute.This forces the cutting edge against the work.Key Blasting Parameters for Deep Hole Excavation in an …Ever increasing mine production capacity and mechanized operations enable advanced drilling equipment to be widely adopted in underground mines.In order to achieve satisfactory blasting performance in tunnel advance,there is a critical need to optimize the blasting technique to match the large deep hole drilling capability.In this study,through theoretical analysis of tunnel blasting,the.
