## Cyanide Leaching Mining SGS
Cyanide leaching has been the industry standard for gold processing for more than 100 years.During the cyanide leach process,a cyanide solution,or lixiviant,is percolated through ore contained in vats,columns or heaps.Gold is dissolved by the cyanide andgold mining cyanide processCyanide Use in Gold Mining Earths Cyanide's efficiency makes mining more wasteful.Because cyanide leaching is very efficient,it allows profitable mining of much lower ore grades.Mining lower grade ore requires the extraction and processing of much more ore.
