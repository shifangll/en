## Cement clinker
Cement clinker is a solid material produced in the manufacture of Portland cement as an intermediary product.Clinker occurs as lumps or nodules,usually 3 millimetres (0.12 in) to 25 millimetres (0.98 in) in diameter.It is produced by sintering (fusing together without melting to the point of liquefaction) limestone and aluminosilicate materials such as clay during the cement kiln stage.Cement Materials Analysis Claisseindustry among other things,the production increase of developed by Claisse® for the analysis of finished products,process samples and raw materials with reference to the cement industry.Using only one flux composition,one sample to flux c The iron ore samples that failed contained magnetite and or high iron.
