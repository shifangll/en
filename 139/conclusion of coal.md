## How much carbon dioxide is produced when different fuels
The amount of CO2 produced when a fuel is burned is a function of the carbon content of the fuel.The heat content,or the amount of energy produced when a fuel is burned,is mainly determined by the carbon (C) and hydrogen (H) content of the fuel.Heat is produced when C and H combine with oxygen (O) during combustion.The Economics of CoalConclusion While many observers have been quick to blame environmental regulations for the decline in coal’s dominance,the truth is that market forces driven by technology progress have been the culprit.But U.S.coal producers see opportunity in overseas
