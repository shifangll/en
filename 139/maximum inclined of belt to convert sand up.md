## CONVEYOR HANDBOOK
1.Materials of construction The composition of a conveyor belt can be considered in two parts: A.The Carcass,whether ply type (textile) or steel cord construction,which must have sufficient strength to handle the operating tensions and to support the load.B.Maximum and Minimum of a mass? Yahoo Answers&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;a) The maximum mass: The free body diagram for M2 is when M2 is on the brink of motion upward: The friction will then oppose motion up the incline,and will add to the gravitational force down the plane.F grav = mgsin24 = 237*9.81*0.4067 = 945.56 newton F

## Steep Incline Conveyors
Steep incline conveyors are a great substitute for drag chain or conveyor bucket elevator configurations,because of the reduced noise and the elimination of transfer points.FEECO’s steep incline conveyors permit the transportation of bulk materials at inclines ranging from 18 degrees to 90 degrees,while still maintaining the feed and discharge properties of a standard belt conveyor.Angles of Incline and Belt Conveyor ConfigurationsAngles of Incline and Belt Conveyor Configurations For handling bulk materials,it is essential that the proper conveyor and belt is used.Traveling up an incline can complicate things quite a bit.Having the wrong tools can lead to delays and slower production speeds.
