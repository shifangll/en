## polymetallic ore in peru
Beneficiation of a Cassiterite Polymetallic Sulphide Ore Situated in Honghe municipality China,Tianfang tin deposit is characterized by Cu Sn polymetallic constituents.Due to the complex mineral composition in the ore,a joint process of flotation and gravity concentration was used to process the ore.By Flotation Of Copper Lead Zinc SulphidesWe have by flotation of copper lead zinc sulphides,Typical leadcopperzinc sulphide minerals were found hard to be separated selectively by froth flotation in the plant practice operation due to part of sphalerite was progressively entrapped into leadcopper bulk flotation.
