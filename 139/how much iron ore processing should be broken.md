## 12.5 Iron And Steel Production
12.5 Iron And Steel Production 12.5.1 Process Description 3 The production of steel at an integrated iron and steel plant is accomplished using several interrelated processes.The major operations are: (1) coke production,(2) sinter production,(3) iron production.Iron and steelThe iron made in a blast furnace is an alloy containing about 90 95 percent iron,3 4 percent carbon,and traces of other elements such as silicon,manganese,and phosphorus,depending on the ore used.Pig iron is much harder than 100 percent pure iron,but
