## Bauxite: The principal ore of aluminum.
Bauxite Used for Aluminum Production Bauxite is the principal ore of aluminum.The first step in producing aluminum is to crush the bauxite and purify it using the Bayer Process.In the Bayer Process,the bauxite is washed in a hot solution of sodium hydroxide.Mining and Refining ProcessBauxite is generally extracted by open cast mining,being almost always found near the surface,with processes that vary slightly depending on the location.Before mining can commence the land needs to be cleared of timber and vegetation.
