## Burning coal refuse in fluid beds (Conference) OSTIGOV
Abstract This paper deals with the application of fluid bed combustion technology to the burning of coal mining waste The designs of two stage fluid bed combustors dryers are demonstrated as useful in the drying of coal,slag and coke,using coal and coal refuse (gob) as fuelCoal waste SourceWatchSep 27,2017&#0183;&#32;Waste coal is usually composed of mixed coal,soil,and rock (mine waste) Most waste coal is burned as is in unconventional fluidized bed combustors For some uses,waste coal may be partially cleaned by removing some extraneous noncombustible constituents
