## CONVEYOR HANDBOOK
1.Materials of construction The composition of a conveyor belt can be considered in two parts: A.The Carcass,whether ply type (textile) or steel cord construction,which must have sufficient strength to handle the operating tensions and to support the load.B.Belt Tension CalculatorBelt Tension Calculator First,the Effective Belt Tension (TE) must be calculated.TE is the sum of the tension required to move the empty belt (TC),the tension required to move the load horizontally (TL),and the tension required to lift the load (TH).Example 1.TE
