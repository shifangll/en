## Ball mill
A ball mill,a type of grinder,is a cylindrical device used in grinding (or mixing) materials like ores,chemicals,ceramic raw materials and paints.Ball mills rotate around a horizontal axis,partially filled with the material to be ground plus the grinding medium.Different materials are used as media,including ceramic balls,flint pebbles andCement millA cement mill (or finish mill in North American usage) is the equipment used to grind the hard,nodular clinker from the cement kiln into the fine grey powder that is cement.Most cement is currently ground in ball mills and also vertical roller mills which are more effective than ball mills.

## Mill (grinding)
Rod mills are less common than ball mills for grinding minerals.The rods used in the mill,usually a high carbon steel,can vary in both the length and the diameter.However,the smaller the rods,the larger is the total surface area and hence,the greater the grinding efficiency.Autogenous millair classifier,air separator,cyclone separatorRSG Inc,located in Sylacauga,Alabama U.S.A.specializes in fine powder technology.The company manufactures air classifiers,ball mills and stirred media mills for the production of fine,superfine and ultrafine powders for the mineral
