Granite was then able to expand upwards causing joints to appear in the rock Joints appeared at points of weakness in the granite rock Susceptible to hydrolysis,and the feldspar in the granite was converted to kaolin clay,as a result of chemical weathering FreezeAbout Kaolin Shree Ram MineralsKaolin is formed when the anhydrous aluminum silicates which are found in feldspar rich rocks,like granite,are altered by weathering or hydrothermal processes.In high concentrations,the mineral produces fine white pieces with a high level of tensile strength,and it can be used to produce several styles of ceramic.

Kaolin is an important raw material in various industries,such as the ceramic,rubber,plastic,ink,chemicals,cement,and paper industries.However,the kaolin mining and process ing industry generates large amounts of waste.The kaolin industry,which processes primary kaolin,produces two types of waste materials.Environmental Characteristics of Clays and Clay Mineral Deposits1 Apr 2009.Clays and clay minerals have been mined since the Stone Age; today they are among the most important minerals used by manufacturing and.Massive kaolinite deposits at the Hilltop pit,Lancaster County,South Carolina; the clays formed by the hydrothermal alteration and weathering of crystal tuff.
