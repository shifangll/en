## Foam Mills
Micrograin solid carbide end mill with three flutes and flat bottom 30 upcut spiral shank without clamping surface DIN HB centre cut with one long flute with polished cutting edge The new foam mills,besides having finely polished cutters also feature chip.Calculating FeedsThe same applies to chip load if the recommended chip load is 0.1 mm tooth the RPM,feed or number of cutting edges may go up or down to maintain the required chip load.Therefore if chip load remains the same,and feed rate increases,either the RPM and or number of cutting edges must increase to maintain the recommended chip load.
