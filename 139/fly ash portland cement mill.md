## Behavior of Concrete by using Waste Glass Powder and Fly.
Cement of 43 Grade.Portland cement (often referred to as OPC,from ordinary portland cement) is the most common type of cement in general use around the world because it is a basic ingredient of concrete,mortar,stucco and most non specialty grout.C) Fly Ash Mineral admixtures like fly ash …Interaction between the Pozzolanic Reaction of Fly Ash …An ordinary portland cement (CEM I 52.5 N),complying with the European Standard EN 197 1 (2000) was used in all mixtures.In this study the detailed effect of a fly ash,Class F according to ASTM Standards and with a low calcium oxide content according to EN 450,was studied on the hydration process of a portland cement fly ash binder.

## Fly ash in cement
Adding fly ash to a cement mill leads to a more homogeneous cement binder.The mixing is more thorough and the coarse part of the fly ash will be ground to finer particles.Thus it is possible to use a higher volume of fly ash.The extensive quality control at a cement plant ensures the standard of the product,andJet mill grinding of portland cement,limestone,and fly.The first system is a blend of OPC and 15% limestone,and the second system is a blend of OPC and 40% fly ash.It was observed that when jet mill grinding is used,the average particle size of the powders is decreased to approximately 4 μm or less with a narrower particle size distribution than that achieved using ball milling.

## Fly ash
Proponents of fly ash claim that replacing Portland cement with fly ash reduces the greenhouse gas &quot;footprint&quot; of concrete,as the production of one ton of Portland cement generates approximately one ton of CO 2,compared to no CO 2 generated with fly ash.Chapter 5The high fly ash content mixes normally contain 95 percent fly ash and 5 percent portland cement.In some areas,self cementing fly ash accounts for 100 percent of the cementitious material.Because the low fly ash content mixes contain an additional ingredient (sand or filler),there is a much broader range of mix proportions.

## Fly Ash
If we have Portland cement,and the fly ash is the pozzolana,it can be represented by silica because non crystalline silica glass is the principal constituent of fly ash.The silica combines with the calcium hydroxide released on hydration of Portland cement.Calcium.Evaluation of the Physical and Chemical Properties of Fly.portland cement selected for the work is a Type I and meets the requirements of ASTM C 311,its chemical composition and physical properties are provided in Table 1 and 2.Table 1.Chemical Composition of the Selected Portland Cement and Fly Ashes Portland cement % by mass

## Fly Ash as a Portland Cement Raw Material
The potential tonnage of raw material that fly ash might substitute for in portland cement is,in essence,the 12.7 million tons of aluminous siliceous materials,that is,…Fly AshWhen portland or portland limestone cement is mixed with water,most of the cement forms insoluble Calcium Silicate Hydrate (C S H) gel; Calcium Hydroxide Ca(OH) 2 is also formed as part of this reaction.When fly ash is introduced into concrete,it reacts with the Ca(OH) 2 to form additional C S H gel.In a properly proportioned mix,fly ash can improve many of the properties of concrete.
