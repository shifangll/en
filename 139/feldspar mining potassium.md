27 Apr 2017.Ensifer adhaerens L18,isolated from potassium feldspar mining area soil,was found to be capable of solubilizing K from an insoluble K bearing mineral source.Here,we report the draft genome sequence and annotation of the feldspar solubilizing bacterium Ensifer adhaerens L18.These data provide the&nbsp;.What is Feldspar Industrial Minerals Association North AmericaChemically,the feldspars are silicates of aluminium,containing sodium,potassium,iron,calcium,or barium or combinations of these elements.The minerals of.Aplite,which is a fine grained igneous rock with the same mineralogical composition as granite,also is mined frequently for its feldspar content.Basically,the two&nbsp;.
