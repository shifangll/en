## Filtration Aids for Phosphoric Acid Production ArrMaz
Filtration Aids For Phosphoric Acid Production.Many wet process phosphoric acid plants use filtration aids to improve gypsum slurry filtration and hence increase production rates and recovery.Filtration aids are based on the principle of producing larger and more homogeneous particles or gypsum crystals to allow for faster drainage.(PDF) Surface Modification of Calcium Sulfate Whisker …In order to obtain hydrophobic whisker for preparing polymeric composite product,the calcium sulfate whisker (CSW) prepared from flue gas desulfurization (FGD) gypsum by hydrothermal synthesis.
