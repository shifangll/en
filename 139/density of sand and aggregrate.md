## Granular material
A granular material is a conglomeration of discrete solid,macroscopic particles characterized by a loss of energy whenever the particles interact (the most common example would be friction when grains collide).[1] The constituents that compose granular material are large enough such that they are not subject to thermal motion fluctuations.Bulk Density and Void Percentage Test for AggregatesThe bulk density and void percentage of aggregate can be evaluated using standard test methods of applicable codes such as ASTM C 29 C29M a,IS: 2386 (Part 3) 1963,or BS 2:1995.The procedure provided in this article is based on the specification of.
