## Aggregate in Concrete
Recycled concrete will have a higher absorption and lower specific gravity than conventional aggregates.To produce good quality,durable concrete containing a portion of recycled concrete aggregate often requires trial concrete mixes and close monitoring of the properties of the old recycled concrete,with mix adjustments made,as needed.Using Recycled Concrete in MDOT's Transportation.2016 2 25&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Data collected from 2009 indicates that concrete pavements are recycled for transportation infrastructure applications in at least 41 states; moreover,about 140 million tons of crushed concrete aggregate (CCA) ar
