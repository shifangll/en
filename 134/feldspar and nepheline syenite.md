## nepheline syenite nepheline syenite .
Nephelene syenite is a holocrystalline plutonic rock that consists largely of nepheline and alkali feldspar.The rocks are mostly pale colored,grey or pink,and in general appearance they are not unlike granites,but dark green varieties are also known.Nepheline Syenite SibelcoMinbloc is the product name for products used as an antiblocking additive in films Minbloc HC is used when the product is based on the mineral nepheline syenite.For non film applications the product name HiFill N is being used.

## Feldspar Statistics and Information
3&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;In glassmaking,feldspar provides alumina for improving hardness,durability,and resistance to chemical corrosion.In ceramics,feldspar is used as a flux,lowering the vitrifying temperature of a ceramic body during firing and forming a glassy phase.Glass and ceramics continued to be the major end uses of feldspar.Nepheline SyeniteNepheline Syenite A.Like feldspar,Nepheline Syenite is used as a flux in porcelains,vitreous and semi vitreous clay bodies,and in glazes.Nepheline syenite contributes high alumina without associated free silica in its raw form.This makes it an excellent tile filler and melter,especially for fast firing.
