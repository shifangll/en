## Synthesis of precipitated calcium carbonate: a review.
The current high global demand for high quality paper,paint,adhesive sealant,and plastic,filler industries cannot survive without unique and high quality precipitated calcium carbonate (PCC).They are used as fillers,additives,and reinforcements.PCC is a key constituent of the modern paper and plastic industry.This article reports the effect of various organic and inorganic additives.BCCF Calcium Carbonate Calcium Carbonate …Ground calcium carbonate,commonly referred to as GCC,is primarily based on limestone and chalk in the UK,though marble stone is imported and processed at a few locations.Precipitated Calcium Carbonate (PCC) is produced through a recarbonisation process or as a by product of some bulk chemical processes.
