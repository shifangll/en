## Mill Article about mill by The Free Dictionary
The main patents for medium speed mills of various types date to the 1860’s to 1890’s.The roller mill was invented by Schranz in Germany in 1870.A medium speed roller mill consists of a hermetically sealed body and a rotating horizontal milling ring to which two rollers up to 1,200 mm in diameter are pressed by springs.Calculate Top Ball Size of Grinding MediaAlthough it was developed nearly 50 years ago,Bond‘s method is still useful for calculating necessary mill sizes and power consumption for ball and rod mills.This paper discusses the basic development of the Bond method,the determination of the efficiency correction factors based on mill dimensions and feed characteristics,and the application of the results to designing grinding circuits.
