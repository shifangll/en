## M Sand
Quarry dust is a byproduct of the crushing process which is a concentrated material to use as aggregates for concreting purpose,especially as fine aggregates.In quarrying activities,the rock has been crushed into various sizes; during the process the dust generated is called quarry dust and it is formed as waste.IOP Conference Series: Materials Science and Engineering.specific gravity of quarry dust of crusher samples as shown in Figure no.2 Figure No.2: Specific gravity for 40 quarry dust crusher samples It was observed that all the samples of quarry dust are in the range of sand,indicating that soil with high silt content replaced by the quarry dust will reduce the swelling and shrinking of the soil.
