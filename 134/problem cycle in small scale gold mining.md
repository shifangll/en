The Mercury Problem in Artisanal Gold Mining.Mercury‐based artisanal and small‐scale gold mining (ASGM) causes more mercury pollution than any other human activity.1 In this practice,mercury metal is used to extract gold from ore as a stable amalgam.The amalgam is then heated to evaporate the mercury and isolate the gold.Mercury Free MiningOver 15 million artisanal and small scale gold miners (ASGM) in developing countries eke out a meager existence—and they have no alternative to using toxic mercury as part of their gold extraction process.Unfortunately,there is a tragic,hidden cost to their health,and to the planet at large.
