## Concrete: Scientific Principles
The role of water is important because the water to cement ratio is the most critical factor in the production of "perfect" concrete.Too much water reduces concrete strength,while too little will make the concrete unworkable.Concrete needs to be workable so that it may be consolidated and shaped into different forms (i.e.walls,domes,etc.).ACI MANUAL OF CONCRETE INSPECTION† High capacity and automated concrete production equipment; † High performance and high strength concrete; and † Epoxy coated and stainless steel clad reinforcement.The need to cover new issues affecting inspection is the reason ACI Committee 311 continues to revise the ACI Manual of Concrete Inspection.
