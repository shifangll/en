## Analysis of total chloride content in concrete
Hence,the limits of total chloride content in concrete could be violated even though the limits of chloride content for mix ingredients are satisfied.Therefore,it can be stated that chloride limits of concrete ingredients and total concrete could not be consistent,especially with mix designs that have water cement ratios higher than 0.48.Chloride Analysis of Sea Sand for Making Concrete,Maximum chloride content of 0075 % by weight of sand could be deemed acceptable for all reinforced concrete work using a 20 mm max aggregate size and Portland cements This assumes that there will be no chlorides added from the coarse aggregate,admixtures or mixing water
