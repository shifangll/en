## (HDH) Processes for Phosphoric Acid Production.
In the wet phosphoric acid process the phosphate rock is dissolved in a phosphoric acid solution and sulphuric acid is added to precipitate the calcium according to the following simplified overall reaction.Ca3(PO4)2 + 3H2SO4 = 2H3PO4 + 3CaSO4 (1) Various side reactions occur concurrently: the most important being the action of sulphuric acid.On the Modelling of Phosphate Rock Acidulation …In the wet processes,phosphoric acid is produced by reacting sulfuric acid with phosphate rock.It should be mentioned that this reaction takes place in the presence of an excessively large amount of H 3 PO 4.When a sufficient degree of crystallization of gypsum is achieved,the crystals are separated by filtration.

## Phosphoric acid production by attacking phosphate …
During the classical production of phosphoric acid,the reaction between sulfuric acid and phosphate rock generates suspension.The latter is subsequently filtered and concentrated by evaporation process resulting in fluorine or acid gas.CN85102768AA circulating process of no draining waste is disclosed.The bothering difficulties of separation and pollution problems in the current hydrochloric acid process of phosphorus rock are thus overcome.By the principle of cooperative effect of HCl,calcium chlorophosphate and calcium chloride can be crystallized separately from the different zones of phase diagram,thus solid calcium.
