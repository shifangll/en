## Choosing Between Liming Materials (A3671)
2014 2 23&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;The purity of an agricultural lime is expressed as its calcium carbonate (CaCO 3) equivalence.This is a measure of the amount of acid a given weight of the material will neutralize compared to pure calcium car bonate.Pure calcium carbonate has an equivalence of 100%; lime with higher magnesium content (dolomitic) will have a higher calcium.What is slaked lime and quicklime?Quick lime is calcium oxide formed by heating limestone ( or occasionally sea shells).Slaked lime is calcium hydroxide which is formed by adding water to the calcium oxide ( quite dangerous due to the severe exothermic reaction ).Calcium hydroxi.
