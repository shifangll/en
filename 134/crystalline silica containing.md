## Respirable Crystalline Silica
Introduction.Crystalline silica is the name for a group of naturally occurring minerals found in many types of rock.It can be released into the air when the rock or articles made from the rock are crushed,cut,or worked in some other way.Respiratory effects of exposure to low levels of …Dusts containing crystalline silica are generated in mining,construction,glass,granite and concrete production industries.The association between exposure to low levels of concrete dust containing crystalline silica and reduction in lung function,was evaluated in a cross‐sectional study.
