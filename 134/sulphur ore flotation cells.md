## How to maximize ore and grade recovery through …
Optimal mineral recovery in a flotation circuit depends on the capacity to adapt to metallurgical variability in the ore being processed.It is possible that some banks of flotation cells might not be recovering ore at their maximum levels due to air flow,feed,mechanical,hydraulic,reagent imbalances.The effect of grinding environment on flotation of.The sulphur content of the ore B was the lowest of all the ores.Since the galvanic interactions between sulphide ore and grinding media are well known from many studies and their relevance.
