Tube mills are usually fed balls smaller than 2 in.whereas or in.balls are more commonly used for ball mill grinding.A much higher grinding capacity is obtained in tube mills by using steel media instead of pebbles,but in making such a conversion serious consideration must be given to the ability of the steel shell to withstand theCoffee Grind ChartA coarse ground will look somewhat chunky.Because the coffee is steeped in boiling water,the contact time between the water and coffee is much longer,which requires a coarser grind.Grinding the coffee too coarse will make the coffee weak.Grinding too fine will make the coffee murky and taste bitter.
