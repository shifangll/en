Jun 26,2018&nbsp&#0183&#32Hi,I'm looking for a WW2 USAAF crusher cap in OD color.Can you recommend a good,reasonably priced maker? This one doesn't look bad,but it doesn't have the crushed look either.Shop by categoryWe work out the trending price by crunching the data on the product’s sale price over the last 90 days.New refers to a brand new,unused,unopened,undamaged item,while Used refers to an item that has been used previously.
