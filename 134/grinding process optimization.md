## Optimization of the Gear Profile Grinding Process.
17&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;between grinding wheel and tooth flank,process optimization is difficult.And in comparison with other grinding processes,these conditions clearly lead to varying grinding conditions along the profile.Examination of the complex geometrical and contact conditions requires fundamental tech nological investigations in an analogy process.Development of a hybrid particle swarm optimization.&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;The hybrid particle swarm optimization regards the entire grinding process parameters (from rough grinding,semi finish grinding,finish grinding to spark out grinding) as a whole,and realizes the parameter optimization by considering multiple objectives and constrains.
