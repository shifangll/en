## How much power does normal grinder consume?
Normal Conventional wet grinder would generate 150 watts of power under normal weight and circumstances.Most wet grinders avail in the market have this as standard and run at 50% efficiency.Vidiems revolutionary new technology does the same job.Grinding MachinesPeel grinding may be considered as one end of the HEDG spectrum of processes.Because a narrow wheel contact width is employed and rather more moderate depths of cut,power consumption is much lower than in HEDG.Grinding wheel wear is minimized and improved grinding ratios are achieved by using high speed superabrasive wheels.
