## Volcanic rock
Any rock that solidifies from lava is a volcanic rock.All volcanic rocks are igneous rocks,and are perhaps more correctly known as extrusive igneous rocks; this is in contrast to magma that solidifies beneath the ground,which is known as plutonic rock or intrusive igneous rock.Volcanic rocks,particularly basalt,makes up much of the Earth's crust,and nearly all of the ocean floor.Pyroclastic conesPyroclastic cones synonyms,Pyroclastic cones pronunciation,Pyroclastic cones translation,English dictionary definition of Pyroclastic cones.a hill,conical in form,built up of cinders,tufa,or lava,during volcanic eruptions.

## Scoria: Igneous Rock
What is Scoria? Scoria is a dark colored igneous rock with abundant round bubble like cavities known as vesicles.It ranges in color from black or dark gray to deep reddish brown.Scoria usually has a composition similar to basalt,but it can also have a composition similar to andesite.Many people believe that small pieces of scoria look like the ash produced in a coal furnace.Igneous Rocks: Everything You Need to KnowMost of the time,they're simple to tell apart.They are all connected in the endless rock cycle,moving from one form to another and changing shape,texture,and even chemical composition along the way.Igneous rocks form from the cooling of magma or lava and compose much of the Earth's continental crust and nearly all of the oceanic crust.
