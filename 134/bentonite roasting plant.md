## Rotary Kiln Roasting
Reductive Roasting Process For The Recovery Of Iron Oxides.The roasting process was conducted at 1000 &#176;C in the presence of N 2 for 4 hours,employing a rotary kiln furnace.The batch masses per experiment were fixed to 1.5 kg pellets,and samples were taken at the following intervals: 1 hour,2 hours,3 hours and 4 hours.Petroleum refiningPetroleum refining Petroleum refining Mercaptan extraction: Simple sweetening is adequate for many purposes,but other methods must be used if the total sulfur content of the fuel is to be reduced.When solutizers,such as potassium isobutyrate and sodium cresylate,are added to caustic soda,the solubility of the higher mercaptans is increased and they can be extracted from the oil.In.
