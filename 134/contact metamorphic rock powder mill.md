## Classes of Rocks
Three Classes of Rocks.—The rocks are divided into three great classes: Sedimentary rocks,made of fragments of older rocks more or less water worn or ground to powder,and then spread out and deposited in layers of gravel,sand,mud,etc.to be later consolidated by pressure and natural cementing.The material may also consist more or less of shells of animals orGrinding Mill,Ultrafine Mill,Ball Grinding Mill,Ultrafine.Coarse Powder Hammer Mill.Coarse Powder Mill engaging in crushing various rocks and stones with comprehensive strength not higher than 320 MPa into fine and micro fine powders,is widely used in metallurgy,mining,chemical,cement,coal,sand making,coal gangue,construction,refractory materials and ceramic industries.
