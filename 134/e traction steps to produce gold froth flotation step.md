## Flotation of Gold and Gold Bearing Ores
1.Background.The application of flotation on a reasonable scale within the gold mining industry commenced in the early 1930s following the introduction of water soluble flotation collectors (specifically xanthates and dithiophosphate collectors) that allowed differential flotation of sulfide minerals (Weinig and Carpenter,1937,Rabone,1939,Richards and Locke,1940,Taggart,1945).Gas Solid SeparationsFOAM SEPARATION AND FROTH FLOTATION 701 20.2.FOAM SEPARATION AND FROTH FLOTATION Foams are dispersions of gas in a relatively small amount of liquid.When they are still on the surface of the which they were formed,they also are called froths.Bubbles range in size from about 50 ~m to several mm.

## Flotation Reagents
2&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Flotation Frothers What is the Function of Frothers.The function of frothers in flotation is that of building the froth which serves as the buoyant medium in the separation of the floatable from the non floatable minerals.Frothers accomplish this by lowering the surface tension of the liquid which in turn permits air rising through the pulp to accumulate at the surface in bubble form.The Advantages of the Imhoflot G Cell Pneumatic …14&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;independent process steps that make up froth flotation i.e.mineral preparation,reagent dispersion,collection,aeration,bubble particle contact and froth separation.As indicated above the separation vessel in Imhoflot is designed only to separate and remove the froth from the tailings slurry and not to contact air bubbles with particles.
