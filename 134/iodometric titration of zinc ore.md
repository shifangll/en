## 13.Redox.Iodometric determination of copper in alloys (pdf,264KB)
The ores of Cu rarely contain more than 1% of this element,this increases the costs of exploitation and.In iodometry,the solution of iodine in aqueous KI is often used (direct titrations).This is possible if.3 Brasses are the alloys of copper with Zn (up to 40%),often with addition of other metals,like Mn,Ni,Pb etc.Those.Redox TitrationRedox Titration is a laboratory method of determining the concentration of a given analyte by causing a redox reaction between the titrant and the analyte.These types of titrations sometimes require the use of a potentiometer or a redox indicator.Redox titration is based on an oxidation reduction reaction between the titrant and the analyte.

5&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;The titration of iodine by thiosulfate tends to yield slightly low results owing to.tin,lead,and zinc (and perhaps minor amounts of nickel and iron).The method is relatively simple and applicable to brasses with less than 2% iron.A weighed samEXPERIMENT 3 Complexometric Titration of Zn(II) with.

## Iodometric Determination of Copper in Brass
As has been mentioned above,the endpoint in a titration of iodine with thiosulfate is signaled by the color change of the starch indicator.Brass formulations also may contain up to 39% Zn,2.5% Sn and 8.5% Pb.When dissolved in concentrated nitric acid,the zinc and the lead become Pb2+ and Zn2+.These do not&nbsp;.AMMONIACAL THIOSULPHATE LEACHING OF A COPPER …24&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;AMMONIACAL THIOSULPHATE LEACHING OF A COPPER RICH GOLD ORE A.Deniz BAS1,*,Elif OZDEMIR1.arsenic,zinc and antimony are often detrimental to the extraction of gold from ores (Alymore and Muir,2000).determined by iodometric titration while free cyanide was analysed by titration with silver nitrate using p
