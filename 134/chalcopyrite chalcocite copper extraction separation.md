## Method of leaching of chalcopyrite
(57) Abstract: The invention can be used in metallurgy for the leaching of chalcopyrite with the purpose of extraction of copper.Method of leaching of chalcopyrite includes the processing of the leach solution of sulphate of iron (III) in the presence of dilute sulfuric acid in the absence of silver as a catalyst while maintaining the surface potential of chalcopyrite in the range 450 mV.Recent Developments in Copper HydrometallurgyyMixed sulfide minerals chalcopyrite,chalcocite,Copper Extraction in 1980s and 1990s Secondary sulfide and oxide ores Primary sulfide,Solid liquid Separation at Bagdad August,2003 32 ©2006 Phelps Dodge Corporation Bagdad Concentrate Leach Plant Copper Production 0
