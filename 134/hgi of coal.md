## Characteristics of Mae Moh lignite: Hardgrove grindability.
3&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;To determine the relative grindability of coal,i.e.whether it is easy or difficult to pulverize,the Hardgrove test is a standard method widely used (Klima,1999).The Hard grove grindability index (HGI) can be then estimated from the test.The higher the index is the easier the coal to be pulverized.Coal in PennsylvaniaCoal is principally derived from plant material,so in order to form coal,a plentiful source of plants is needed.Because dead plant material is very delicate and subject to decay when left exposed to the atmosphere,a method of protecting it is necessary.Finally,coal is very much unlike plant material in appearance,having been considerably.

Lignite is the lower rank of coal.The lignite is softer than bituminous coal,with a HGI in the range of One Hundred making it easier to pulverize.Hardgrove Grindability Index Wiki EveripediaHardgrove Grindability Index's wiki: Hardgrove Grindability Index (short HGI ) is a measure for the grindability of coal.Grindability is an index,therefore it has no unit.The smaller the HGI,the harder is coal texture and less grindable is the coal.Grindability is an impo.

## hgi values and its effect coal crushing saplgroup.in
The Hardgrove grindability index (HGI) is the most expedient.There is a close relation between HGI and the coal quality,as well as the power consumed in grinding.Accordingly,the HGI values of coal samples may be used to optimize the crushing of coal as a preliminary to coke production.
