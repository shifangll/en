## Principle and Working of MILLING.
&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;Introduction: Milling is the cutting operation that removes metal by feeding the work against a rotating,cutter having single or multiple cutting edges.Flat or curved surfaces of many shapes can be machined by milling with good finish and accuracy.A milling machine may also be used for drilling,slotting,making a circular profilVertical Milling Machine23&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;by progressively removing material from a work piece.The vertical milling machine also can function like a drill press because the spindle is perpendicular to the table and can be lowered into the work piece.Mill Study Guide P.1 Advanced Photon Source

## A Closer Look at Vertical and Horizontal Milling Machines
In vertical mills,the spindle axis is vertically oriented.Milling cutters are held in the spindle and rotate on its axis.Typically the spindle can be extended,or the table raised or lowered to produce the same effect,allowing for plunge cuts and driDynamic Modal Analysis of Vertical Machining Centre ComponentsThe paper presents a systematic procedure and details of the use of experimental and analytical modal analysis technique for structural dynamic evaluation processes of a vertical machining centre.The main results deal with assessment of the mode shape of the different components of the vertical machining centre.The simplified experimental modal analysis of different components of milling.
