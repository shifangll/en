## shear rate
The velocity gradient measured across the diameter of a fluid flow channel,be it a pipe,annulus or other shape.Shear rate is the rate of change of velocity at which one layer of fluid passes over an adjacent layer.As an example,consider that a fluid is placed between two parallel plates that are 1.0 cm apart,the upper plate moving at a velocity of 1.0 cm sec and the lower plate fixed.Choosing an optimum sand control methodThis indicates that the magnitude of the skin is also an important parameter to choose a sand control method for a sand producer well.So,before choosing a method to prevent sand production,it is important to know the skin factor of the method and evaluate well production economically for a specific period.Production system for pre.
