## What is crushing in mineral processing? AnswersDrive
Mineral processing,art of treating crude ores and mineral products in order to separate the valuable minerals from the waste rock,or gangue.It is the first process that most ores undergo after mining in order to provide a more concentrated material for the procedures of extractive metallurgy.Crushing technology2020 2 28&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;The material is crushed by the elliptic course of movement and falls down due to gravity.This occurs until the material is smaller than the set crushing gap.The crushing energy acts on the feed material with strong forces and a low speed.The name jaw crusher is derived from the crusher jaws necessary for crushing and the &quot;chewing&quot; motion.
