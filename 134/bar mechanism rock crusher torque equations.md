## stone crusher mechanism in d
A crusher is a machine designed to reduce large rocks into smaller rocks,gravel,or rock dust.Crushers may be used to reduce the size,or change the form,of waste materials so they can be more easily disposed of or recycled,or to reduce the size of a solid mix of raw materials (as in rock ore),so that pieces of differ3.Synthesis of mechanism systemsMotor torque requirements are studied by varying major robot geometry approach for re using CAD geometry for multi body modelling of a rock drilling rig boom.Paper F presents synthesis using graph theory and number synthesis equations dimensional synthesis the mechanism link length optimisation is performed.
