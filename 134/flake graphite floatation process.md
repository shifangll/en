## GRAPHITE Separating the flake from the carbon
17&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Commercial flake graphite products are available in a range of purities from around 80% carbon up to 99% carbon.Flake which is in the purity range of 98% typically represent materials which have been beneficiated using only froth floatation.Flake above 98% purity has been purified using other methods subsequent to floatation.18&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Figure 10 Sample with spiky graphite present in the matrix due to too elevated level of Pb.Flake Graphite on the Casting Surface This is commonly seen in foundries,however many ignore the flake graphite on the surface as it forms part of the machining allowance.
