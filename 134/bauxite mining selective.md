## Selective Mining Article about Selective Mining by …
selective mining[si′lek&#183;tiv ′mīn&#183;iŋ] (mining engineering) A method of mining whereby ore of unwarranted high value is mined in such manner as to make the low grade ore left in the mine incapable of future profitable extraction; in other words,the best ore is selected in order to make good mill returns,leaving the low grade ore in the mine.Mining Bauxite SelectiveBauxite is generally extracted by open cast mining,being almost always found near the surface,with processes that vary slightly depending on the location.Before mining can commence the land needs to be cleared of timber and vegetation.Alongside this process may be the collection of seeds and or saplings,for inclusion in a seedbank,which.
