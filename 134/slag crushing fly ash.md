## The Difference in Slag Cement and Fly Ash
Fly ash and slag cement work well together in certain applications and can be used to achieve higher strength gains,corrosion resistance and lowered concrete permeability.The optimum mixture proportions for ternary blends,as with other concrete,will be dependent on the final use of the concrete,construction requirements and seasonal.Crushing machines for slag containing metalsWith our vertical shaft crushing machines,metals from slag and slag like materials can be recovered as secondary raw materials.At the same time,their mineral components are treated in such a way that it remains possible to market them (e.g.as building materials).
