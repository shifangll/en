## Extraction of metals Iron
11&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Iron is extracted from its ore,haematite,by reduction with carbon.This takes place in a blast furnace (named after blasts of air [20% oxygen],heated to 1000 &#176;C,which are blasted into the bottom of the furnace): A mixture of crushed iron ore,coke (an almost pure form of carbon) and limestone is fed into the top of the blast furnace.How do you extract iron from its ore? AnswersDriveExtracting iron from iron ore using a Blast Furnace.The common ores of iron are both iron oxides,and these can be reduced to iron by heating them with carbon in the form of coke.Coke is produced by heating coal in the absence of air.See Full Answer.3.

## How Is Iron Extracted From the Earth? Reference.com
Iron ores in the form of hematite (ferrous oxide) and magnetite are removed from the earth through mining.The use of heavy mining equipment is necessary to dig out large pits in an area with a large deposit of iron ore; however,because iron does not occur naturally,it is necessary to use a blast furnace to separate or refine iron from the other substances in the iron ore.Extraction of Iron Metallurgy Blast Furnace and …The purpose of a Blast Furnace is to reduce the concentrated ore chemically to its liquid metal state.A Blast furnace is a gigantic,steel stack lined with refractory brick where the concentrated iron ore,coke,and limestone are dumped from the top,and a blast of hot air is blown into the bottom.
