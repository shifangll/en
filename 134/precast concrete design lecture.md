## Bridge Design Precast Concrete Bridge Beam Design …
Design a simply supported prestressed concrete Y beam which carries a 150mm thick concrete slab and 100mm of surfacing,together with a nominal live load udl of 10.0 kN m 2 and kel of 33kN m.The span of the beam is 24.0m centre to centre of bearings and the beams are spaced at 1.0m intervals.Precast Concrete Floors in Steel Framed Buildings19&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;hospitals and car parks.Structural design guidance of this effective structural combination is covered by previously published three SCI publications,Design of composite beams using precast concrete slabs (P287),Design of asymmetric Slimflor beams with precast concrete slabs (P342) and Design of multi storey braced frames (P334).
