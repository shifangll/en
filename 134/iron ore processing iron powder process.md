## Iron processing
Iron processing Iron processing Ores: Iron ores occur in igneous,metamorphic (transformed),or sedimentary rocks in a variety of geologic environments.Most are sedimentary,but many have been changed by weathering,and so their precise origin is difficult to determine.The Extraction of IronCast iron has already been mentioned above.This section deals with the types of iron and steel which are produced as a result of the steel making process.Wrought iron: If all the carbon is removed from the iron to give high purity iron,it is known as wrought iron.Wrought iron is quite soft and easily worked and has little structural strength.

## Different Types of Iron Ore
2&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Hematite is the most important iron ore.The iron content of the pure minerals is as follows: Ankerite is a carbonate of lime,magnesia,manganese,and iron.It is of valuable composition,carries only 14 or 15% of iron,and is used more for its lime and magnesia as a flux than for its iron content.What Is Iron Ore Beneficiation? (with pictures)31&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Iron ore beneficiation is a multi stage process that raw iron ore undergoes to purify it prior to the process of smelting,which involves melting the ore to remove the metal content.The process of iron ore beneficiation has two complementary goals and these define the methods used to refine it.The iron content of the ore needs to be increased and gangue,which is native rock and minerals of.
