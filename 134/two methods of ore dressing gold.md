4&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Sometimes open pit mining is used,such as at the Fort Knox Mine in central Alaska.Barrick Gold Corporation has one of the largest open pit gold mines in North America located on its Goldstrike mine property in northeastern Nevada.Other gold mines use underground mining,where the ore is extracted through tunnels or shafts.What is crushing in mineral processing? AnswersDriveOre deposits formed by lateral secretion are formed by metamorphic reactions during shearing,which liberate mineral constituents such as quartz,sulfides,gold,carbonates,and oxides from deforming rocks,and focus these constituents into zones of reduced pressure or dilation such as faults.
