## Ecuador
The general situation for the clinker producers has been a slight increase in cement production to 10Mt for the 12 months to the end of November 2018 and slightly higher increases in despatches.So,it looks like an apparent cement demand is up in Peru and the importers are rushing t3.3The reason for this is that at the very high temperatures in the kiln,many chemical components in the raw ingredients are burned off and replaced with oxygen from the air.Table 3.3 lists just some of the many possible raw ingredients that can be used to provide each of the main cement …
