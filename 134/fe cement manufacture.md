## What is Cement? History
3&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Cement,one of the most important building materials,is a binding agent that sets and hardens to adhere to building units such as stones,bricks,tiles etc.Cement generally refers to a very fine powdery substance chiefly made up of limestone (calcium),sand or clay (silicon),bauxite (aluminum) and iron ore,and may include shells,chalk,marl,shale,clay,blast furnace slag,slate.Cements20&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;• review the standards with which cements must comply and the applications for different cement types • describe in outline methods used for chemical analysis and to study the hydration of cement • briefly outline some health and safety aspects related to cement use 1.2 History of Portland cement manufacture

## Manufacture of Portland cement
2018 1 19&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Portland Cement.Cement: is a material with adhesive and cohesive properties which make it capable of bonding minerals fragments into a compact whole.For constructional purposes,the meaning of the term &quot;cement&quot; is restricted to the bonding materials used with …Utilisation of by product jarosite in the manufacture …22&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Jarosite,a residual by product generated by the zinc industry during the hydrometallurgical process,contains predominantly Fe 2 O 3,SO 3 and alkalis with a small amount of ZnO.These constituents are known to contribute significantly in the formation of clinker mineral phases and,therefore,the jarosite could be an effective mineraliser and activator in the manufacture of ordinary Portland.
