## Copper Mining and Processing: Processing of Copper …
Copper processing is a complicated process that begins with mining of the ore (less than 1% copper) and ends with sheets of 99.99% pure copper called cathodes,which will ultimately be made into products for everyday use.The most common types of ore,copper oxide and copper sulfide,undergo two different processes,hydrometallurgy and pyrometallurgy,respectively,due to the different.Chapter 7 Energy Use in the Copper Industry20&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;MINERAL PROCESSING Grinding and concentration together consume about 45 percent of the energy used in the pro duction of cathode copper.Assuming an ore grade of 0.55 percent and a recovery rate of87.5 6.4 percent copper in the concentrate,concentrat ing 1 ton of copper ore requires over 200 billion Btu,or approximately 42 million Btu ton of.
