## Mining methods
3&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Underground Mining Theory and Experiences is place where theory and design examples for underground mines can be found.What are the main methods of mining? American.5&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;There are four main mining methods: underground,open surface (pit),placer,and in situ mining.Underground mines are more expensive and are often used to reach deeper deposits.Surface mines are typically used for more shallow and less valuable deposits.Placer mining is used to sift out valuable metals from sediments in river channels,beach sands,or other environments.In situ mining.

In the upcoming articles,health and safety aspects of the current underground mining methods will be discussed in detail to understand how and why such stringent mining practices were introduced,and what kind of impact these changes have had on the industry on a national scale.Underground MiningUnderground mining is more complex and more expensive than open pit mining.Where removing the overburden would be too costly or ineffective to reach the ore,the decision is made to go underground.After open pit mining is complete,valuable ore can be mined through underground mining methods.

## Digging deeper: Mining methods explained Anglo …
Underground mining is practical when: The ore body is too deep to mine profitably by open pit.The grades or quality of the orebody are high enough to cover costs.Underground mining has a lower ground footprint than open pit mining.The underground mining methods we use include room and pillar,narrow vein stoping and large scale mechanised.Coal miningCoal mining Coal mining Underground mining: In underground coal mining,the working environment is completely enclosed by the geologic medium,which consists of the coal seam and the overlying and underlying strata.Access to the coal seam is gained by suitable openings from the surface,and a network of roadways driven in the seam then facilitates the installation of service facilities.
