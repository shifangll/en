## Processing of Nickel Laterite Ores on the Rise
Image: Nickel Ore Dryer.Some novel processes may employ pelletizing at this stage of the process,where drying also facilitates pulverization of the ore in preparation of processing on a disc pelletizer.Pelletizing may also be used as a means of reintroducing recycle to the process.Copper1&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Copper is a chemical element with the symbol Cu (from Latin: cuprum) and atomic number 29.It is a soft,malleable,and ductile metal with very high thermal and electrical conductivity.A freshly exposed surface of pure copper has a pinkish orange color.Copper is used as a conductor of heat and electricity,as a building material,and as a constituent of various metal alloys,such as sterling.
