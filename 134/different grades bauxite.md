## CHINA BAUXITE MARKET MONTHLY UPDATE CM …
Over the past two years,the global traded bauxite market has undergone a transformational change,with China increasing its imports from 52 Mt in 2016 to an estimated 82 Mt in 2018.Supply side dynamics have seen different countries and suppliers entering and exiting the market with a frequency not seen in other bulk material markets.Bauxite DepositsBauxite deposits invariably contain a range of impurities,ranging from organic material to trace elements such as Ga,Zn,Pb,P and Be.Table 2.1 shows typical compositions of a range of smelter aluminas.In the Bayer process,many impurities are at least partially soluble in the caustic digestion liquor and may be carried over into precipitation if they are not removed in the desilication.
