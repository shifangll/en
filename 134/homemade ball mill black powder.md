## My homemade black powder
&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Used my homemade black powder in my TC black diamond express today with some boolits sent to me by someone on the site.The powder performed really well with both 450gr.505 and.245gr power belts.The recoil was a little lighter than commercial powder but it had a nice crack to it.Much less smoke than other powers that I have used with still a very satisfiying smell.Homemade black powder substitute? The High Road&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Midland Man is right on,you need a good shop press to corn the powder to be able to measure the powder by volume when loading a muzzleloader,and a ball mill with lead round balls in it to mix the ingredients in.It's not hard to do and it's safe unless you get a spark into the powder,which cannot happen if you use the lead balls.
