## Temperature Analysis in a ball bearing with heat.
17&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Temperature Analysis in a Ball Bearing under Heat Generation caused by Friction.project for MIE 605.Benjamin Rembold.1996.Abstract.Friction in bearings causes an increase of the temperature inside the bearing.If the heat produced cannot be adequately removed from the bearing,the temperature might exceed a certain limit,and as a result.Friction and Temperature Rise18&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Bearing operating temperature is determined by the equilibrium or balance between the amount of heat generated by the bearing and the amount of heat conducted away from the bearing.In most cases the temperature rises sharply during initial operation,then increases slowly until it reaches a stable condition and then remains constant.

## SKF Bearing Knowledge: Heat bearing mounting
The temperature difference between the bearing and seating depends on the magnitude of the interference fit and the bearing size.Normally a bearing temperature of 80 to 90 &#176;C (144 to 162 &#176;F) above that of the shaft is sufficient for mounting.Never heat a bearing to a temperature greater than 125 &#176;C (257 &#176;F),unless otherwise specified.What's normal: The role of temperature in bearing …4&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;A simple rule for troubleshooting bearing temperatures: No more than 180 degrees Fahrenheit (82 degrees Celsius) on the housing.The bearing outer ring can be up to 20&#176;F (11&#176;C) hotter than the housing.The lubricant originally specified for the application was likely selected to run at lower.
