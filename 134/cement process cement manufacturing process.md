## Process of Manufacturing of Cement
Process of Manufacturing of Cement The cement is manufactured by integrating the calcareous component and argillaceous component in ratio of 3 : 1.The calcareous component can be limestone,chalk,marine shells,marl whereas argillaceous components can be shale,clay,blast furnace slag,slate.Manufacturing process27&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;A clean and revolutionary cold manufacturing process.Hoffmann Green has initiated a technological breakthrough based on changing the composition of cement so that it does not contain clinker,the main source of CO2 emissions in traditional cement production,as well as creating a cold and clean cement manufacturing process (no firing of raw materials).
