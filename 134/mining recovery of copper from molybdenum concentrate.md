## Molybdenum Processing
Flotation separates the metallic minerals from the gangue this way and in the case of copper molybdenum ores separates molybdenite from copper sulphide.The resulting MoS 2 concentrate contains between 85% and 92% MoS 2.Further treatment by acid leaching can be used to dissolve impurities like copper and lead if necessary.How is Molybdenum Mined and Processed? …Molybdenum mining and processing technology have been improving since 1916,when Climax molybdenum was first mined near Leadville,Colo.At present,the main molybdenum mines in the world are distributed in the countries near the American continental divide,such as Canada,the United States,Mexico,Peru,Chile and China,and the CIS (Commonwealth of Independent States) countries.

## Review on Flotation and Separation of Copper and.
The separation of copper and molybdenum ores was comprehensively stated.The development of copper depressors included sodium sulfide,thioglycollic acid and other new depressors were reviewed.In connection with the problems in separation,some prospects were addressed respectively such as potential regulator,heat treatment and nitrogen blowing.(PDF) Estimation of Copper and Molybdenum Grades …In training and testing phases,it achieved quite correlations of 0.98 and 0.93 for Copper grade,of 0.99 and 0.92 for Copper recovery,of 0.99 and 0.92 for Molybdenum grade and of 0.99 and 0.94.
