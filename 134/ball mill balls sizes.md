## Ball Mill
Ball mills tumble iron or steel balls with the ore.The balls are initially 5 10 cm diameter but gradually wear away as grinding of the ore proceeds.The feed to ball mills (dry basis) is typically 75 vol. % ore and 25% steel.The ball mill is operated in closed circuit with a particle size measurement device and size control cyclones.100 kg ball mill size and details&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;This video is unavailable.Watch Queue Queue.Watch Queue Queue

## Ball Mill: Operating principles,components,Uses.
The balls which could be of different diameter occupy 30 50% of the mill volume and its size depends on the feed and mill size.The large balls tend to break down the coarse feed materials and the smaller balls help to form fine product by reducing void spaces betThe hardness of grinding media ballFrom the way the ball mill works.In the operation environment,the ball mill is divided into two types: wet ball mill and dry ball mill.Dry Ball millwork has a strong corrosion,so as the same wear resistant grinding media ball,the wear resistant grinding media ball in the wet grinding efficiency is faster.
