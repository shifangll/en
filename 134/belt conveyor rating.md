## What is belt rating?
Hello RATED BREAKING STRENGTH (N mm) Rated breaking strength is 10 times the calculated working tension.The total strength is the total of the number of plies x tensile strength of each ply eg 800 4 is 4 x 200 N mm plies.NUMBER OF FABRIC PLIES T.Belt Conveyor Sizing Tool3&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Conveyor motor sizing forms calculate the necessary Torque,Speed,Stopping Accuracy and System Inertia important when selecting a proper motor for the application.Total weight mass of loads and conveyor belt W m = lb kg.Friction coefficient of the belt and linear guide.

## BELT CONVEYORS
20&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;The design of belt conveyor systems has been one of the most common occurrences in the South African mining field for over one hundred years.Conveyors are seen on virtually all mining installations,and are the biggest problem for the plant maintenance engineer,being the cause of most plant shutdowns.Conveyor Belt Strength Rating&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Can anyone explain why the Recommended Working Tension Rating (Vulcanized Splice) quoted by almost all manufacturers is only 10% of the Minimum Full Thickness Tensile Strength of the belt ? What is the basis for this and should we ignore the Tensile Strength and use only the Working Tension Rating in design calculations ? Would appreciate a response.
