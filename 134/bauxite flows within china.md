As one official involved in the privatization of Guyana’s bauxite industry said,there are only so many global players in the aluminium industry: “you can put them on a show of one hand”.China,the world’s biggest consumer of bauxite has warped in recent years commodity flows,inadvertently locking Guyana within Rusal’s supply chain.FOCUS: Pricing bauxite and alumina Metal Bulletin.comBauxite too can be regarded as a standalone market,with prices not necessarily bound to follow alumina,or aluminium,higher or lower,but greater spot liquidity,which will facilitate the evolution of more sophisticated,bauxite specific pricing mechanism; experiences of volatility,in alumina and further afield,should spur their adoption in.
