## Carbon Stripping Denver Mineral Engineers
Acid washing is currently being done both in a separate vessel from the stripping column and in the elution vessel.Factors favoring acid washing in the elution vessel include: (1) eliminating a carbon transfer which reduces gold losses from fine carbon breakage of loaded carbon,(2) conservation of heat if hot acid washing is employed and (3.Soil washing for metal removal: A review of physical.1.Introduction.In the United States,heavy metals are prevalent at almost all sites targeted by major remediation programs.For instance,metals are present in 77% of the Superfund sites (National Priorities List),in 72% of the Department of Defense (DOD) sites and in 55% of the Department of Energy (DOE) sites.The USEPA estimates that over 50 million cubic meters of soil at current NPL.
