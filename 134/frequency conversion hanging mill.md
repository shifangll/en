## Phase Converter vs VFDs,which to use? Wolf Automation
&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;Many motors are dual rated for 208 240Vac 460Vac.If your motor is,the best approach is to rearrange the motor wires for the 220Vac,3 phase input.This way you can use either a rotary phase converter (RPC) or a variable frequency drive (VFD) to run the motor off of 220Vac single phase voltage.Frequency changerA frequency changer or frequency converter is an electronic or electromechanical device that converts alternating current of one frequency to alternating current of another frequency.The device may also change the voltage,but if it does,that is incidental to its principal purpose,since voltage conversion of alternating current is much easier to ach
