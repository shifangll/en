&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;I did a cube crushing test in an experiment and for my two cubes i got the results of 29.84 KN and 24.19 KN now i need to work out the compressive strength compressive strength (N mm^2) = maximum load cross sectional area the dimensions of the cube was 100m x 100m x 100m I have to compare these with some set results that came out will compressive strengths of 50 37 however …Effect of Cement Water Ratio on Compressive …1&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;plots of density and aggregates of concrete versus cement water ratios.TABLE I.VARIATIONS OF WEIGHT,DENSITY,AND COMPRESSIVE STRENGTH OF CONCRETRE MIXES WITH CEMENT WATER RATIO S N Cement Water Ratio Age (days) weight of cube (g) Density of cube (g cm3) Crushing load (kg) Compressive Strength (kg cm2) a 1.3 7 8232 2.90
