## What is Wafer Thinning? Integra Tech
Oct 01,2013&#0183;&#32;Wafer thinning is the process of removing material from the backside of a wafer to a desired final target thickness The two most common methods of wafer thinning are conventional grind and chemical mechanical planarization (CMP) Conventional grinding is an aggressive mechanical process that utilizes a diamond and resin bonded grind wheel.Waferdicing &amp; GrindingThe thinning of wafers is called grinding.As a rule,the grinding process takes place in several steps,each with a finer grain of the grinding wheels.On the one hand,this serves to optimize the process duration and,on the other hand,to reduce the damage to the crystal caused by grinding in the crystal.
