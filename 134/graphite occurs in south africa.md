## carbon Facts,Uses,&amp; Properties Britannica
Graphite occurs naturally in many areas,the deposits of major importance being in China,India,Brazil,Turkey,Mexico,Canada,Russia,and Madagascar.Both surface and deep mining techniques are used,followed by flotation,but the major portion of commercial graphite is produced by heating petroleum coke in an electric furnace.where is graphite found in south koreaSouth Korea Graphite Projects Battery Mineral Resources.Although graphite occurs most commonly in metamorphic rocks,deposits of graphite mineral can also be found in igneous rocks.BMR has a high level of knowledge about how this mineral forms and where to find graphite sheets.
