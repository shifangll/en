## Cyanide Use in Gold Mining
Cyanide's efficiency makes mining more wasteful.Because cyanide leaching is very efficient,it allows profitable mining of much lower ore grades.Mining lower grade ore requires the extraction and processing of much more ore to get the same amount of gold.Partially due to cyanide,modern mines are.much larger than before cyanide was used;The Metallurgy of Cyanide Gold Leaching An …Leaching gold with a cyanide solution remains the most widely used hydrometallurgical process for the extraction of gold from ores and concentrates.Despite the difficulties and hazards of working with cyanide,no other process has yet been proven to be an economic viable alternative.

## Gold Cyanidation
Cyanide can be used to extract gold,either in a controlled mill environment,or more crudely on rock piles in the open.Cyanide &quot;vat leaching&quot; mixes finely crushed ore with a cyanide salt in water.The cyanide binds to the gold ions,and makes them soluble in water,thereby allowing separation from the rock.Sudanese environment expert warns for the use of …The pollution caused by the use of cyanide and mercury in gold mining “constitutes the largest and most dangerous threat to the country’s environment”,says a Sudanese environment protection expert.“The use of cyanide and mercury will definitely lead to an environmental disaster in the country,” El Jeili Hamouda Saleh,Professor of Environmental Law at the Bahri University in.
