## Optimization of mill performance by using
16&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;As the ball wear rate depends directly on the surface of the media charge,a small variation in power will lead to an important increase of wear rate.The risk of underloading or overloading the mill is an additional factor.A direct measurement of the ball level in the mill,more accurate than power readings,as well as a control of it,isLaboratory studies in comminution: Part VI The specific.29&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;the larger particles.The ball milling gave an abnormal rate of breakage of the larger sizes,but the rod milling gave a normal breakage pattern with an acceleration in breakage when less than 15 per cent of the initial feed size material remained.Based on results from dry grinding various materials in a laboratory ball mill,Austin et al.
