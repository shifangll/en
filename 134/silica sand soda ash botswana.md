## Glass Manufacture ANSAC: American Natural Soda Ash,
Soda lime silica glass combines three essential ingredients Silica (sand) is the glass forming oxide,lime provides chemical stability and soda ash acts as the fluxing agent Soda ash plays a vital role by reducing the furnace temperature necessary to melt the silica used,thus reducing the energy required to produce glass As a cost effective.Glass Bottle Manufacturing Glass Beverage BottlesSoda ash is added to even the melting profile of the silica sand and limestone is added to enhance durability Cullet is simply recycled glass; because it has a lower melting point than the raw materials,adding it to the mix can cut energy costs at a glass manufacturing plant
