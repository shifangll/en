## Availability of dicalcium phosphate to plants,when.
The availability of dicalcium phosphate in powder and granulated form mixed with ammonium sulfate,was tested in a greenhouse experiment.Two soils were used in the experiment: one from Rehovot,neutral and non calcareous,and the other from Gilat,slightly alkaline and calcareous.Clover (two cuttings) was the first crop and cow peas and corn succeeded.The yield results were fitted to.Feed phosphate quality29&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;The table gives an analysis from several independent laboratories of the phosphorus content and relative solubility of some typical feed phosphates.All the samples were analysed according to the same methodology and the results show the differences between mono and dicalcium phosphate …
