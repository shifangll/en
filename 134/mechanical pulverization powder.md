## Recycling waste tire rubber by water jet pulverization.
AbstractPulverization is a general strategy used prior to any practical application of recycled waste tire rubber (WTR).Mechanical grinding,in use currently,is an inefficient technique due to low quality rubber powder production and certain indispensable additional pretreatments.The aim of this study is to propose a novel pulverization technique of WTR by ultrahigh pressure water jet.CN103483238B20&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;The method of preparing atorvastatin atorvastatin calcium trihydrate,characterized by comprising the following steps: 1) taking atorvastatin calcium as the starting material the crude product,75 &#176; c drying,remove the mechanical pulverization,the pulverized fine

## Pulverization
When sufficient mechanical force is applied,chain scission occurs and macroradicals are formed,which then act as initiators for further reactions,i.e.the creation of block or graft copolymers as in situ compatibilising agents.Powder formation occurs due to the high shear and pressure that leads to fragmentation of the feedstock.Powder Metallurgy MachineMfgVarious methods for making powder.A method of converting metal and alloy or metal compound into powder in a solid state.Include: (1) Mechanical pulverization and galvanic corrosion methods for making metal and alloy powders from solid metals and alloys: (2) Reduction method for making metal and alloy powders from solid metal oxides and salts
