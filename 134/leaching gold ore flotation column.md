## The Metallurgy of Cyanide Gold Leaching An …
With lower gold grades beneficiation (usually flotation) is often used ahead of leaching to increase the grade of Au and reduce the quantity of ore to be leached.Nature of Gold: The surface of a gold particle will typically be dissolved at a rate of around 0.0.5 &#181;m of surface depth per hour in a cyanide leach.For large gold particles and.ore flotation gold ore leaching process newGold Leaching Chemical Extraction Methods From Ore Buy.Cyanide process can be divided into mixing cyanide and the percolation cyanide.Mixing cyanide is to re election the gold mineral after amalgamation,tailings and flotation,or use for all slime cyanide; but percolation cyanide is used for processing flotation tailings and low grade gold ore heap leaching etc.

## Extraction of gold by heap leaching
Pump leaching is a process that grind gold mine with low grade to a certain particles,heap up on the leakage proof bottom mat that concreted by pitch,concrete or plastic cloth,spray the low concentration cyanide solution,alkaline solution ， nontoxic solvent ， dilute sulphuric acid on the stock heap,make the gold dissolve ， the solution with gold heap up,then use active carbon.VALVES FOR GOLD LEACHING IN CIL,CIP OR CIC CIRCUITS27&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;pulp (CIP) or carbon in column (CIC) circuits.The gold leaching process starts with comminution.The run of mine ore is crushed and ground to a fine particle size.Water is added to the process to create a mud like slurry.The slurry is then pumped into a thickener,where the gold bearing particles sink to the bottom,where they are fed for.
