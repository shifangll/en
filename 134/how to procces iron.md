## Iron in the Industrial Revolution
As the industrial revolution developed,so did the iron industry.A set of innovations,from different materials to new techniques,allowed iron production to expand greatly.In 1709,Darby became the first man to smelt iron with coke (which is made from heating coal).Iron processing Britannica2&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Iron processing,use of a smelting process to turn the ore into a form from which products can be fashioned.Included in this article also is a discussion of the mining of iron and of its preparation for smelting.Iron (Fe) is a relatively dense metal with a silvery white appearance and distinctive

## Rust Explained
Rust is the process of iron (molecules) oxidizing into iron oxide,or rust.Rust is the common name for a very common compound,iron oxide.Iron (or steel) rusting is an example of corrosion,an electrochemical process involving an anode,an electrolyte and a cathode.When metal corrodes,the electrolyte helps provide oxygen to the anode.Puddling process metallurgy BritannicaPuddling process,Method of converting pig iron into wrought iron by subjecting it to heat and frequent stirring in a furnace in the presence of oxidizing substances (see oxidation reduction).Invented by Henry Cort in 1784 (superseding the finery process),it was the first method that allowed wrought iron to be produced on a large scale.
