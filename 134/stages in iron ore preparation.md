## Steps in the Modern Steelmaking Process
Today,steel production makes use of recycled materials as well as traditional raw materials,such as iron ore,coal,and limestone.Two processes,basic oxygen steelmaking (BOS) and electric arc furnaces (EAF),account for virtually all steel production.﻿ ﻿ Ironmaking,the first step in making steel,involves the raw inputs of iron ore.Raw Material PreparationThe sintering process begins with the preparation of a sinter mixture consisting of iron ore fines,fluxes,solid fuel (called bonding agents in Japan) such as coke breeze,and return fines from the sinter plant and blast furnace as well as recycled ferruginous materials from downstream iron and steelmaking processes.

## IRON AND STEEL
2&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;This page looks at the use of the Blast Furnace in the extraction of iron from iron ore,and the conversion of the raw iron from the furnace into various kinds of steel.The common ores of iron are both iron oxides,and these can be reduced to iron by heating them with carbon in the form of coke.What Is Iron Ore Beneficiation? (with pictures)31&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Iron ore mining often focuses on looking for hematite deposits known as red iron ore,and magnetite,as they have naturally weak magnetic fields that aid in their purification.Hematite,however,responds better to the flotation process in iron ore beneficiation than magnetite,so it is the preferred type of ore.

Iron ore is extracted in mines and open pit mines,and then supplied to special iron ore enrichment works (known as GOKs) for preparation and beneficiation.Here,it goes through several stages: Crushing and grinding This reduces the size of the ore pieces by crushing,abrasion,cracking or impact.Iron Preparations,Oral Monograph for Professionals,Pediatric Patients Iron Deficiency Anemia Prevention Oral Premature or low birthweight infants: 2 4 mg kg daily starting preferably at 1 month,but at least by 2 months,of age a Do not exceed 15 mg daily a Normal full term infants who are not breast fed or are only partially breast fed: 1 mg kg daily,preferably as iron fortified formula,starting at birth and continuing during the first.
