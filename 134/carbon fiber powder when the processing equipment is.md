## Carbon Fiber Properties
23&ensp;&#0183;&ensp; Carbon Fiber is not yet geared to Amateur techniques.In order to maximize Carbon Fiber Characteristics,a relatively high level of technical excellence must be achieved.Imperfections and air bubbles can significantly affect performance.Typically,autoclaves,or vacuum equipment is required.Safety Precaution for Handling of Carbon FiberCarbon fiber producers are tight lipped about how their product is manufactured.Each producer’s fiber differs from those of its competitors,and the processing details that give each brand its signature characteristics are considered to be intellectual property.The carbon fiber manufacturing process also is notoriously difficult and expensive.
