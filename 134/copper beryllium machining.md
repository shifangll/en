## Beryllium and you
5&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Beryllium is a lightweight,strong,steel grey metal,and its oxide (beryllia) is a hard,white ceramic.Copper beryllium alloys are 97% copper,containing up to 3%.beryllium.Where is it found? Beryllium is used in industry in three main forms as beryllium metal,as berylliumRam Electrical Discharge Machining (EDM) on Copper.24&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;operations where copper beryllium (CuBe) alloys are processed and toprovide the reader with information on exposure and exposure control options such as work practice,administrative and engineering controls.Introduction An airborne beryllium exposure assessment was conducted during Ram Electrical Discharge Machining (EDM) of CuBe Alloy 25.

## Beryllium Copper Alloys
One of the highest strength copper based alloys available on the market today is beryllium copper,also known as spring copper or beryllium bronze.The commercial grades of beryllium copper contain 0.4 to 2.0 percent beryllium.The small ratio of beryllium to copper creates a family of high copper alloys with strength as high as alloy steel.Beryllium copperBeryllium copper (BeCu),also known as copper beryllium (CuBe),beryllium bronze and spring copper,is a copper alloy with 0.5—3% beryllium and sometimes other elements.Beryllium copper combines high strength with non magnetic and non sparking qualities.It has excellent metalworking,forming and machining properties.It has many specialized applications in tools for hazardous environments.
