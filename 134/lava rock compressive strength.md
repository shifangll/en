## The effect of water content on the strength of rock …
Types of rock strength are compressive strength,tensile strength and shear strength.Compressive strength is commonly representing the strength of rock in order to resist to compressive stress while tensile strength is rarely measured and shear strength is usually used in unconfined condition which it is ability to resist directly to shear stress.Chapter 11 of Rock EngineeringIntact rock strength Hoek Brown constant Geological Strength Index Friction angle Cohesive strength Rock mass compressive strength Rock mass tensile strength Deformation modulus Poisson's ratio Dilation angle Post peak characteristics Broken rock mass

## Compressive Strength
Compressive strength is the standard strength parameter of concrete that can be evaluated under site conditions as well.The most common method is to use cylinder cores drilled off the structure.Momber (1998b) was probably the first to suggest to use the way how a cylinder fails during the compression test as a criterion of the material behaviour during hydrodemolition.
