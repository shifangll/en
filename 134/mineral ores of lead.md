## Uses of Lead Lead Deposits and Resources
19&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Lead commonly occurs in mineral deposits along with other base metals,such as copper and zinc.Lead deposits are broadly classified on the basis of how they are formed.Lead is produced mainly from three types of deposits: sedimentary exhalative (Sedex),Mississippi Valley type (MVT),and volcanogenic massive sulfide (VMS).Lead Ore Mineral Deposits in Nigeria with their …Most mineral ore contains lead with only about 3 of these minerals commercially viable,they are galena,cerussite,and anglesite and is mostly found in conjunction with other metals like zinc and silver.Lead mineral ores are mostly mined as a by product of the above stated valuable metals.
