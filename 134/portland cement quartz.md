Typical bags of commercial &quot;Portland cement&quot; also contain additives.Because Portland cement is a mixture and not a single compound,a representative pure bulk sample of the PC material must be collected at the time of air sampling for laboratory use to resolve this variability in composition.A Close Look at Portland Cement21&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;The pervasiveness of portland cement in both industry and home applications means that users tend to approach PC with reduced vigilance.OSHA’s RCS regulation defines crystalline silica as “quartz,cristobalite,and or tridymite.” Geologists recognize these three forms as the major forms of crystalline silica,with quartz as the most.
