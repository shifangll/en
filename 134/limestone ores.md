## Uses of Limestone
Limestone rock is a sedimentary rock which forms in the process of sedimentation at the bottom of lakes and oceans,or in caves.It is mainly composed of mineral calcite and aragonite,both of which are crystal forms of calcium carbonate.A limestone with 95 percent or more of calcium carbonate by weight is known as a high calcium limestone.Metal Ores And Limestone Are Connected With QuarriesMetal Ores And Limestone Are Connected With Quarries，we Ltd.is a large sized joint stock enterprise integrated with the scientific research,production and sales of heavy mining machinery.It is located in high and new technology industrial development zone,Zhengzhou with an area of 200,000 m&#178;.
