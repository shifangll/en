## Simple Metal Detector: 8 Steps (with Pictures)
The other day when I was searching instructables I come across on interesting and simple circuit for metal detector It is build with 555,coil and few other components Instructable that inspire me to do this project was this oneHow do I make a metal detector circuit with Arduino? : arduinoHow do I make a metal detector circuit with Arduino? (selfarduino),They look dirt simple,all they are are some inductors,transistors,speakers etc I thought it would be a relatively simple (famous last words) project to do with Arduino as all I would have to do is make a few lines of script to make the board switch the current really.
