## CEMENT and CONCRETE TECHNOLOGY
2&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Mineral admixtures include fly ash,hydrated lime,silica fume and ground blast furnace slag.Many of these materials have cement like properties,augmenting the strength and density of the finished concrete.They generally improve the workability,density and long term strength of concrete,at the expense of set time and early strengths.What is Cement? History5&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Cement,one of the most important building materials,is a binding agent that sets and hardens to adhere to building units such as stones,bricks,tiles etc.Cement generally refers to a very fine powdery substance chiefly made up of limestone (calcium),sand or clay (silicon),bauxite (aluminum) and iron ore,and may include shells,chalk,marl,shale,clay,blast furnace slag,slate.

## Fly Ash Topic
Fly ash is a by product from the combustion of pulverized coal,and is widely used as an ingredient in hydraulic cement concrete.Because it improves many desirable properties of concrete,it is introduced either as a separately batched material or as a component of blended cement.Fly ash reacts with the hydrating hydraulic cement to form a cementing medium.FLY ASH CONCRETEFLY ASH CONCRETE IS BETTER FOR THE ENVIRONMENT.More than 12 million tons of coal fly ash are used in concrete products each year.The use of fly ash,a recovered resource,reduces the depletion of natural resources.It also reduces the energy intensive manufacturing of portland cement.
