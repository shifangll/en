## Experimental investigation on cutting mechanism of …
This paper describes an experimental investigation on the cutting mechanism of laser sintered material using small ball end mill focusing on the temperature of the cutting edge.Sintered material was produced by irradiating a laser beam on a layer of loose fine SCM Ni Cu powder.Bulk carbon steel AISI 1055 was selected as reference steel.JML Experimental Colloid MillJML experimental colloid mill is making of stainless steel or half of stainless steel.The grinding equipment basic principle is fluid or semi liquid materiel through high speed relative correlation between the tooth and tooth,make the material by powerful shear force,friction force and the action such as high frequency vibration,effectively shatter,emulsion,homogeneous,temperature.
