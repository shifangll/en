## Distillation
24&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Distillation is the process of separating the components or substances from a liquid mixture by using selective boiling and condensation.Distillation may result in essentially complete separation (nearly pure components),or it may be a partial separation that increases the concentration of selected components in the mixture.Diabetic Foot Ulcers Treatment &amp; Management: …22&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Diabetic foot ulcers,as shown in the images below,occur as a result of various factors,such as mechanical changes in conformation of the bony architecture of the foot,peripheral neuropathy,and atherosclerotic peripheral arterial disease,all of which occur with higher frequency and intensity in the diabetic population.{file40038}{file400.
