## MINERAL COMMODITY PROFILES: CADMIUM
1&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Cadmium is a soft,low melting point metal that has many uses.It is similar in abundance to antimony and bismuth and is the 63d element in order of crustal abundance.Cadmium is associated in nature with zinc (and,less closely,with lead and copper) and is extracted mainly as a byproduct of the mining and processing of zinc.Cadmium Statistics and Information4&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Zinc to cadmium ratios in typical zinc ores range from 200:1 to 400:1.Sphalerite (ZnS),the most economically significant zinc mineral,commonly contains minor amounts of other elements; cadmium,which shares certain similar chemical properties with zinc,will often substitute for zinc in the sphalerite crystal lattice.
