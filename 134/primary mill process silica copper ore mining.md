## silica mining process
Copper processing is a complied process that begins with mining of the ore (less than 1% copper) and ends with sheets of 99.99% pure copper called hodes,which will ultimately be made into products for everyday use.The most common types of ore,copper oxide and copper sulfide,undergo two different processes,hydrometallurgy and pyrometallurgy.how mill used in copper ore mining processIn copper ore processing plant,crushing process is the important process.In this copper ore crushing plant,several crusher machines are used.Jaw crusher for copper ore: Jaw crusher is the coarse crushing machine used in cooper ore primary crushing process.Jaw Crusher is mainly used to crush kinds of mining stones primarily,and the largest.
