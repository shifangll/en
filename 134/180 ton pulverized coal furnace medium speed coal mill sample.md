## Evolution of Blast Furnace Iron Making IspatGuru
Evolution of Blast Furnace Iron Making.This bigger hearth furnace produced 880 tons day at a coke rate of 922 kg ton.The first 1000 ton day furnace was commissioned in 1929.a large number of the BFs were using some form of fuel (mostly pulverized coal) injection.Today,many BFs use fuel injectants 40 % to 45 % of the fuel rate.The.Mineral Concentrate Marketing2&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;The object of this Concentrate Marketing post is to draw attention to the benefits of modern milling practice,thus enabling the miner and mill operator to plan their operations so as to net the highest commercial return.By making such products as will be in demand,they may thus take advantage of conditions existing in the various smelters where the concentrates must be sold.

## PULVERIZED COAL FURNACES
Pulverized coal (pulverized fuel pf) has been fired in rotary cement kilns (see Kilns) and boiler furnaces (see Boilers).The latter are basically boxes lined with tubes in which water is evaporated and contain a water steam mixture.The coal is pulverized to a fine powder,usually so that 70% is less than about 75 μm in size,before being carried by part of the combustion air stream to the.Pulverized Coal Burner Specificationrotary furnace complete w refractory works,wheeled rollers,chain drive by gearmotor.combustion airbox,louver type,adjustable wheel,structure &amp; forced draft fan; main pulverizer with motor,screw feeder with gearmotor,base plate,etc.coal crusher with motor with discharge screw,complete with base frame &amp; structure
