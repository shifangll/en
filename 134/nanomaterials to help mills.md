## Nanomaterials
Nanomaterials offer some distinct advantages to remediation technologies such as large surface area to volume ratio and high chemical reactivity.Superfund researchers are also looking at how nanomaterials behave in the environment as they are used for remediation.Nanoparticles Affect Health alive&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;For instance,fixed nanomaterials are embedded in stable matrices (present in sports equipment and textiles),therefore posing low risk to consumers.In contrast,freely engineered nanomaterials are not immobilized in a matrix,and can unintentionally escape into the air o

## Ball Mills
Ball mills are commonly used for crushing and grinding the materials into an extremely fine form.The ball mill contains a hollow cylindrical shell that rotates about its axis.This cylinder is filled with balls that are made of stainless steel or rubber to the material contained in it.Ball MillingThere is a prevailing impression that the ball mill is a recent development; however,ball mills were used extensively in Montana and other western states for crushing ores for concentration as far back as 1898.Its present prominence is due in part to its recent successful
