## Ball mill
A ball mill,a type of grinder,is a cylindrical device used in grinding (or mixing) materials like ores,chemicals,ceramic raw materials and paints.Ball mills rotate around a horizontal axis,partially filled with the material to be ground plus the grinding medium.Different materials are used as media,including ceramic balls,flint pebbles and stainless steel balls.FUNdaMENTALS of Design2018 7 28&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;bearings are still running decades and decades after they were first built.The principal problem with hydrodynamic bearings,however,is that the thickness of the hydrodynamic layer,and hence the accuracy of the bear ing,depends on speed.Perhaps this is what led to the development of exter nally pressurized,or hydrostatic bearings.
