## Difference Between Iron and Steel Difference Between
There are many differences between iron and steel.Primarily,iron is an element while steel is an alloy comprising of iron and carbon.However,in this alloy iron is present in a greater quantity.You can add various other metals to steel so as to produce alloys that have different properties.For.Pig IronPig iron is an intermediate product obtained during the smelting of iron ore using high carbon fuel,such as coke,charcoal or anthracite.In addition to iron,pig iron consists of varying amounts of phosphorus,sulfur,manganese,silicon,and carbon.

## Iron Production
The iron found in iron ores are found in the form of iron oxides.As a result of these impurities,iron must be first separated from the gangue and then converted to pure iron.This is accomplished by the method of pyrometallurgy,a high temperature process.The high temperatures are needed for the reduction of iron and the oxidation of the.Continuous Measurements of the Pig Iron …The pig iron and slag samples should be taken as they are today,for mainly safety aspects.By using continuous temperature measurement,some of the sub goals can be achieved for a more stable process.The economy on the other hand has shown that large savings can be done by using this continuous temperature method due to a more stable process.

## Iron Ore Smelting Process
The pig iron can be further refined to produce steel or wrought iron.Both these methods reduce the carbon content of the pig iron,which in turn reduces the brittleness property of the metals.Wrought Iron Process.Wrought iron is produced by pummeling the pig iron using mechanically driven hammers in a wrought iron works.
