## Mill (grinding)
28&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;A mill is a device that breaks solid materials into smaller pieces by grinding,crushing,or cutting.Such comminution is an important unit operation in many processes.There are many different types of mills and many types of materials processed in them.Historically mills were powered by hand (e.g.via a hand crank),working animal (e.g.horse mill),wind or water ().Used 2000tpd Cement Clinker Grinding …2.Raw material preparation.In the cement production line,producing each 1 ton of Portland Cement need grinding at least 3 tons of materials (including raw materials,fuel,clinker,mixed materials,gypsum).Grinding operation consumes power about 60% of total power in cement plants,raw material grinding takes more than 30%,while coal mill used in cement plant consumes 3%,cement grinding.
