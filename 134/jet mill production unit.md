## Dry Grinding
The s Jet &#174; System (patent pending) is a new innovation in a line of consistent developments being made in the area of air jet milling.Final finenesses in the submicron range (example: d 50 0.2 &#181;m) can now be achieved with fluidized bed jet mills.As opposed to conventional dry grinding processes with fluidized bed jet mills,the s Jet &#174; System uses superheated steam as its milling gas.Jet millA jet mill grinds materials by using a high speed jet of compressed air or inert gas to impact particles into each other.Jet mills can be designed to output particles below a certain size,while continue milling particles above that size,resulting in a narrow size distribution of the resulting product.
