## Mercury Free Gold Extraction Using Borax for Small Scale,
Small scale gold mining is the largest anthropogenic contributor of mercury pollution on planet Earth The miners grind gold ore together with mercury in order to recover the fine gold grains The gold amalgam is burned whereby the mercury evaporates and gold is left behind This processing extracts only a fraction of the gold in the ore and the released mercury causes serious global health.Mining in Death Valley Death Valley National Park (US,Public outcry over high impact mining such as the 400 feet deep Boraxo Mine led to increased protection for all national parks Since the 1848 discovery of gold in California,Death Valley has experienced over 140 years of boom and bust mining From the 1880s to the early 1900s,mining was limited.

## The Pantanal Safari: Borax in Gold Mining?
Mar 14,2014&#0183;&#32;The process occurs in five steps: grinding,washing,mixing,heating and extraction Gold ore is first crushed,then “washed” in the stereotypical gold pan,mixed with borax in a 1 to 3 ratio by volume,heated over a coal or acetylene fire,and removed once gold drops have accumulatedGold Recovery : 8 Steps (with Pictures)The Borax Method is a technique of artisanal gold mining,with its basis in the principle that borax reduces the melting point of all minerals,including precious metals like gold.The melting point of gold is 1063 ˚C,which is a higher temperature than can be obtained by cheap torches and burners.By adding borax to the heavy mineral.
