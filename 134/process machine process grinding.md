## The Importance of Material Grinding in Manufacturing
Grinding Process.The grinding wheel consists of several abrasive particles which act as minute cutting edges,and these particles are bonded with the help of bonding material.The advantage of using such a process over conventional metal removal processes are as follows.The rate of removal of material is much higher than,say,a traditional fileChapter 17: Cutting Tool Applications ‚Äî Grinding Methods.Belt grinding has become an important production process,in some cases replacing conventional grinding operations such as the grinding of camshafts.Belt speeds are usually in the range of 2,500 to 6,000 ft min.Machines for abrasive belt operations require proper belt support and rigid construction to minimize vibration.

## Grinding Machines
Grinding is a means of giving a more accurate finish to a part already machined,but is also a machining process in its own right.The main types of machine are: the ‚Äòsurface grinding machine‚Äô for flat surfaces; and the ‚Äòcylindrical grinding machine‚Äô for cylindrical surfaces.Modeling and Simulation of Process Machine ‚Ä¶Interaction of process and machine in grinding of hard and brittle materials such as cemented carbide may cause dynamic instability of the machining process resulting in machining errors and a decrease in productivity.Commonly,the process and machine tools were dealt with separately,which does not take into consideration the mutual interaction between the two subsystems and thus cannot.
