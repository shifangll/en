10&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Ammonia and urea are two chemicals which are very important to the New Zealand economy.This article covers a process used by Petrochem in Kapuni,South Taranaki,to synthesise ammonia from natural gas and air,then synthesise urea from this ammonia and carbon dioxide.Annually 105 000 tonnes of pure ammonia (300 T day ) are produced inAspen Plus Ammonia Model University Of MarylandAmmonia is produced basically from water,air,and energy The energy source is usually hydrocarbons,thus providing hydrogen as well,but may also be coal or electricity Steam reforming of light hydrocarbons is the most efficient route,with about 77% of world ammonia capacity being based on,
