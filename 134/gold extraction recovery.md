A gold recovery pretreatment process is disclosed in which the gold content is more completely extracted from refractory sulfidic ores which contain large quantities of metal carbonates such as dolomite than occurs in traditional gold extraction methods.The process includes treating the ore in an autoclave at elevated temperature and oxygen overpressure conditions in the presence of soda ash.Gold ExtractionThe increase in gold extraction can be attributed to increases in residual Cu(II) in solution with increasing pH value resulting from the increase in free NH 3 (Senanayake,2004a,b).Leaching at a higher pH value can also be beneficial in improving silver extraction and stabilizing silver in solution.
