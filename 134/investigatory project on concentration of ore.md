## investigatory project on concentration of ore
investigatory project on concentration of ore.Ore Wikipedia.The ore grade,or concentration of an ore mineral or metal,as well as its form of occurrence,will directly affect the costs associated with mining the ore.The cost of extraction must thus be weighed against the metal value contained in the rock to determine what ore can be.SYLLABUS Annexure1&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Note: Any investigatory project,which involves about 10 periods of work,can be chosen with the approval of the teacher.Recommended Textbooks.1.Chemistry Part I,Published by NCERT.Concentration of ore is carried out by digesting the powdered ore with a concentrated solution of NaOH at 523 K and 35 bar pressure.Al.2.O.3.

## Molecular Orbital Theory Chemical Bonding and …
Molecular orbital theory Features of Molecular orbital theory 1)The atomic orbitals overlap to form new orbitals called molecular orbitals.When two atomic orbitals overlap or combine,they lose their identity and form new orbitals.The new orbitals thus formed are called molecular orbitals.2)Molecular orbitals are the energy states of a molecule in which the …Zone RefiningThe principle of zone refining is that the impurities in an ingot or ore of metal are more soluble in the melt state when compared to the corresponding solid state of the impurities.In the zone refining process,the impurities are concentrated at one end of the block of metal so that the rest of the block is purified.
