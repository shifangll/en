## Rock Fragmentation by Blasting
23&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Rock blasting is not a precise science because in the field,it is difficult to make tests where the parameters are kept constant.The most difficult parameter to control is the detonation velocity,and especially when water sensitive explosives are used.Chapter 8 BLAST DESIGN11&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;may represent as much as 80 percent of the total drilling and blasting costs,mainly because of utilization of the lower cost explosive.By contrast,in the northeastern United States,hard rock formations exist in a relatively wet environment,where the explosives costs can be as much as 70 percent of the total drilling and blasting expense.
