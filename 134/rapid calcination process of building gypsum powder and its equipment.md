## 11.16 Gypsum Manufacturing
10&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;11.16 Gypsum Manufacturing 11.16.1 Process Description 2 Gypsum is calcium sulfate dihydrate (CaSO4 2H2O),a white or gray naturally occurring mineral.Raw gypsum ore is processed into a variety of products such as a portland cement additive,soil conditioner,industrial and building plasters,and gypsum wallboard.To produce plasters orGypsum productsSETTING OF GYPSUM PRODUCTS The reaction between gypsum products and water produces solid gypsum,and the heat evolved in the exothermic reaction is equivalent to the heat used originally for calcination.Set gypsum products probably never attain 100% conversion unless they are exposed to high humidity for a long time.

## What is Gypsum How Gypsum is Processed M&amp;C
Gypsum (CaSO 4 &#183;2H 2 O) can be calcined and grinded to obtain β type hemihydrate gypsum (2CaSO 4 &#183;H 2 O),that is,building gypsum,also known as cooked gypsum or plaster.The model gypsum can be obtained when the calcination temperature is 190 &#176;C,and its fineness and whiteness are higher than that of building gypsum.Standard Specification for gypsum blockGypsum Powder Calcination Equipment;.a large number of water vapor screen produced in the decomposition process of the spread of flame also plays the role of barrier.Fast refers to the rapid production of gypsum building materials,high construction efficiency.General construction gypsum of the final setting time between 30 minutes.
