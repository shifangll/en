## How Is Iron Extracted From the Earth? Reference.com
Iron ores in the form of hematite (ferrous oxide) and magnetite are removed from the earth through mining.The use of heavy mining equipment is necessary to dig out large pits in an area with a large deposit of iron ore; however,because iron does not occur naturally,it is necessary to use a blast furnace to separate or refine iron from the other substances in the iron ore.ferric sulphate production process Solution for ore …18&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;A process for the production of liquid ferric sulfate from finely divided ferric oxide,sulfuric acid and water in a closed reaction vessel at temperatures … PROCESS FOR PRODUCING FERROUS SULFATE M &amp; T Chemicals Inc.Generally speaking,this invention relates to a process for the production of ferrous sulfate from scrap iron.
