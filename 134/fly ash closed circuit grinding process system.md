## VRM paper
24&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;INTRODUCTION Traditionally,the closed circuit ball mill with high efficiency separator has been the most common system for cement grinding.However,as happened with raw grinding over the last 25 years,the vertical roller mill (VRM) is now successfully being used for many clinker grinding applications and is rapidly becoming the standard for new grinding installations.Production Yield,Fineness and Strength of Cement as.15&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;on the energy consumption is provided by the type of grinding system.Energy consumption for normal cement fineness at 3600 cm2 gm varies according to the system.Generally,44,41,35,and 32 kWh t are consumed by tube mill open circuit,tube closed circuit,tube mill with pre grinding unit,and finish grinding system,respectively.
