6&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;For extracting gold from low grade ores,heap leaching is practiced; huge heaps are sprayed with a dilute solution of sodium cyanide,and this percolates down through the piled ore,dissolving the gold.There are very well defined rules for the safe and responsible use of cyanide as laid out in the International Cyanide Code.Gold refiningGold Cyanidation6&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Cyanide is manufactured and distributed for use in the gold and silver mining industries in a variety of physical and chemical forms,including solid briquettes,flake cyanide and liquid cyanide.Sodium cyanide is supplied as either briquettes or liquid,while calcium cyanide is supplied in flake form and also in liquid form.

8&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;“The world has been waiting for a cost effective,non toxic solution to gold processing and Clean Mining now offers that solution.” Currently,around 75% of gold extracted from ore is processed using the hazardous chemicals of cyanide or mercury,which are toxic to humans and the environment.Extraction of gold using cyanide24&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Extraction of gold using cyanide Gold is found in very low concentrations in the ore from which it is mined.To collect the gold from the ore it needs to be separated from the other minerals in the ore.To do this the gold needs to be made into a soluble form so that it can be separated from the other minerals as gold is insoluble.

## On the volatilisation and decomposition of cyanide.
About 90% of the world's gold mining workforce is represented by artisanal and small scale gold miners,producing around 15% of the world's gold.In Colombia there are about 200,000 artisanal gold miners,using mainly mercury for the gold processing (Cordy et al.2011).The amalgamation process suffers a low capability of mercury recovering.The Metallurgy of Cyanide Gold Leaching An …Liberation: Cyanide leaching will only be effective if the cyanide can come in contact with the gold particle.For this to happen,the ore should either be sufficiently porous for cyanide to reach the gold,or more usually the ore is crushed and ground to a size at which the surface of the gold is exposed i.e.the gold …

## How is cyanide used in gold mining?
Cyanidation is used to extract gold from a finely ground ore material in a mix with water at about 55% solids by mass.Gold extraction is always a surface processing based extraction process and has nothing to do with the process of Mining itself.Cyanide Use in Gold MiningCyanide's efficiency makes mining more wasteful.Because cyanide leaching is very efficient,it allows profitable mining of much lower ore grades.Mining lower grade ore requires the extraction and processing of much more ore to get the same amount of gold.Partially due to cyanide,modern mines are.much larger than before cyanide was used;
