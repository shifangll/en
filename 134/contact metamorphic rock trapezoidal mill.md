Metamorphism means,“change in form” and metamorphic rocks result after existing rock forms are transformed.The original rock is subjected to heat and pressure,which causes profound physical and or chemical change.Metamorphism is the alteration of a parent rock into a metamorphic rock.MyloniteMylonite is a foliated metamorphic rock that is composed of intensely flattened minerals in a fine grained streaked matrix.Mylonites form deep in the crust where temperature and pressure are high enough for the rocks to deform plastically (ductile deformation).
