## A new practical method for determining the LA abrasion.
In Australia,the LA abrasion method is available in the Australian Standards (AS 1141.23),whereas other standards,such as ASTM C131 C131M,may be used in other parts of the world.1.2.Los Angeles abrasion.The LA abrasion test is a standard method for measuring the abrasion resistance of unbound granular materials (Kahraman et al.2010).A Mill Abrasion Test for Wear Resistance of Armour StoneThe abrasion mill test uses increments of milling time to generate a weight loss curve,the slope of which gives the abrasion resistance index.This new index,k s is compared with wet attrition and aggregate abrasion values for a suite of 11 rocks with wide ranging strengths.Los Angeles Abrasion Test results are briefly mentioned.
