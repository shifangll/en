## Correct Ratios for Concrete Mixes
When batching by volume,it is safe to assume that one wheelbarrow load is equivalent to two sacks of cement.Since sand bulks in volume when it is damp,the mix ratio table (below) is based on the use of damp bulked sand.If you are measuring dry sand,reduce the quantity of each batch by 20 25 percent.concreteworks ILOcontent is measured to determine the exact quantities of gravel,sand,cement and water.For most concrete works carried out on rural roads,however,the above rules of thumb can be applied.12.4 Water to Cement Ratio.When water and cement is mixed,it forms a paste that coats and binds the aggregate particles together&nbsp;.
