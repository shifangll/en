This process works because deposits of iron ore,such as those comprised of magnetite and hematite,alter the earth’s magnetic field and cause magnetic anomalies.In magnetic prospecting,probes are used to measure these local anomalies and find iron ore deposits.This saves on exploration costs.With simulation,you can analyze and improve.Recognition of the regional lineaments of Iran: Using.The relationship between major structural lineaments and locations of ore deposits in Iran has been investigated using geospatial data.In the course of lineament extraction,satellite images,aeromagnetic data,digital elevation model (DEM) and structural maps were processed and the lineaments and large scale faults were identified.
