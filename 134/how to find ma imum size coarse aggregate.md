## The future of coastal and estuarine modeling: Findings.
A fundamental difficulty related to turbulence modeling for coastal problems concerns the relationship between stratification and turbulence (see the review by Umlauf and Burchard,2005).Although parameterization of stratified turbulent mixing remains an active area of research (e.g.Gregg et al.2018,Monismith et al.2018),most coastal models produce reasonable results with stability.Elemental and morphological analyses of filter tape.22&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Elemental and morphological analyses of ﬁlter tape deposits from a beta attenuation monitor John G.Watson a,b,⁎,Judith C.Chow a,b,L.
