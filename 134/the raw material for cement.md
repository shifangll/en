## RAW MATERIALS IN CEMENT PRODUCTION
Chalk is soft raw material,it does not require crushing.Marl is a limestone with admixtures of silex and clay substances,as well as iron oxide.It is a transitional stage to clay.The hardness of marl is lower than the hardness of limestone The more clay substances,the lower its hardness.This is an excellent raw material for cement production.Recycling of sewage sludge as cement raw material in Japan27&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;usable as a cement raw material,which dries up the sludge with heat generated by the following hydration reaction.CaO + H2O → Ca(OH)2 + 15.33 kcal mol The product,called dried powder sludge,is sterilized,very low in moisture content and odorless.It can then be utilized as a raw material of Portland cement and fuel at the same time.

## Cement
6&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Cement Cement Extraction and processing: Raw materials employed in the manufacture of cement are extracted by quarrying in the case of hard rocks such as limestones,slates,and some shales,with the aid of blasting when necessary.Some deposits are mined by underground methods.Softer rocks such as chalk and clay can be dug directly by excavators.The excavated materials are transported.How Cement Is MadeThe finely ground raw material or the slurry is fed into the higher end.At the lower end is a roaring blast of flame,produced by precisely controlled burning of powdered coal,oil,alternative fuels,or gas under forced draft.As the material moves through the kiln,certain elements are driven off in the form of gases.
