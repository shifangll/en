## Microstructure of Bentonite in Iron Ore Green Pellets.
In wet iron ore green pellets,clay tactoids (stacks of parallel primary clay platelets) were very well dispersed and formed a voluminous network occupying the space available between mineral particles.When the pellet was dried,bentonite was drawn to the contact points between the particles and formed solid bridges,which impart strength to.Sintering Technology Using Parallel Granulation …Sintering Technology Using Parallel Granulation Process at High Pellet Feed Ratio.and pellet plants,the blending ratio of sinter in blast furnace raw materials accounts for 40 to 50 mass%.Sinter plant use mainly iron ore with a particle less than about 5 mm,which called sinter feed.The oxidation rate of simple Ore M1 mini pellet.
