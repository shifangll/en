The stability of a transverse cylindrical grinding process is investigated in this paper.The workpiece is considered as a rotating damped hinged hinged Euler Bernoulli beam and the grinding wheel a rotating damped spring mass system moving along the workpiece.Called regenerative force,the contact force between the workpiece and the wheel is a functional equation related to both the current.Chatter Stability of Metal Cutting and Grinding.This paper reviews fundamental modeling of chatter vibrations in metal cutting and grinding processes.The avoidance of chatter vibrations in industry is also presented.The fundamentals of orthogonal chatter stability law and lobes are reviewed for single point machining operations where the process is one dimensional and time invariant.

## Nonlinear Stability and Bifurcation of Multi D.O.F.
The nonlinear chatter in grinding machine system is discussed analytically in the paper.In higher speed grinding process,the self excited chatter vibration is mostly induced by the change of grinding speed and grinding wheel shape.Here the grinding machine tool is viewed as a nonlinear multi D.O.F.autonomous system,in which hysteretic factors of contact surfaces are also introduced.strong adap ility low costs grinding ball mills manufacturerresultsquality advantages gtm cement vertical mill,cement production pc.specific during working,the vertical roller mill do not have the noise of steel ball crashing in ball it can reduce the over grinding and ensure product quality s ility.SERVICE ONLINE
