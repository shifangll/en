## How to maximize ore and grade recovery through …
Flotation continues to be one of the most important tools in mineral separation and processing of complex ores.Today,while the mining industry is focused on chasing higher productivity from existing assets,the ever evolving technology has opened entirely new possibilities in controlling flotation processes.Flotation columns: Getting the most from fine oresFlotation columns: Getting the most from fine ores; Flotation columns: Getting the most from fine ores.The first flotation machine design to use the column concept was developed by Town and Flynn in 1919 a column was used with an injection of air in the bottom by a porous plate.
