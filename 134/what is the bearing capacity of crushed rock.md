NUMERICAL SIMULATION STUDY ON PRESTRESSED ANCHORAGE MECHANISM IN A CRUSHED ROCK SLOPE The embankments consisting of 3 cm and 15 cm diameter crushed rock have poor cooling effect,which will have 0.21 ℃ and 0.28 ℃ decrease in temperature,respectively,where air speed at the bottom approximate zero.Rock Allowable Bearing Capacity&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;One alternate approach is to do some SPT borings.If you get refusal,I would give them 3000 psf and so much the better,and if not,you could model the bearing capacity and settlement based on SPT data using sand models.That should be conservative compared to actual capacity and settlement as based on rock.
