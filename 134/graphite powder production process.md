## Forming process of graphite material Graphite …
Guo Quangui,Liu Zhanjun,Liu Lang and others have invented a process of isostatic pressing graphite,in which the materials of first mixing and rolling are extruded into thin rods of 6~10mm,and the fine rods are carbonized,broken and sifted,and then mixed,rolled,crushed and sifted twice to obtain compacted powder.Forming.The graphite.Fast and fully scalable synthesis of reduced graphene.Exfoliation of graphite is a promising approach for large scale production of graphene.Oxidation of graphite effectively facilitates the exfoliation process,yet necessitates several lengthy.
