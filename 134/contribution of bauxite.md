## Geological contribution to the Fongo Tongo bauxite.
Fongo Tongo found in the western region of Cameroon,is the second bauxite potential in this country.The present geological study of these bauxite deposits is aimed to identify these materials,and determine their morphological,mineralogical and geochemical features.Aluminum Minerals Education CoalitionBauxite ore is the main source of aluminum and contains the aluminum minerals gibbsite,boehmite,and diaspore Aluminum is used in the United States in packaging,transportation,and building Because it is a mixture of minerals,bauxite itself is a rock,not a mineral,possible by a generous contribution from Newmont Mining.
