The Emax is an entirely new type of ball mill for high energy milling.The unique combination of high friction and impact results in extremely fine particles within the shortest amount of time.The high energy input is a result of an unrivaled speed of 2000 min 1 and the optimized jar design.…Ball MillThe ball mill is a tumbling mill that uses steel balls as the grinding media.The length of the cylindrical shell is usually 1 1.5 times the shell diameter (Figure 8.11).The feed can be dry,with less than 3% moisture to minimize ball coating,or slurry containing 20 40% water by weight.

Colloid mill is a machine used in the disintegration of solid particles or droplet size of a liquid present in suspension or emulsion.The machine consists of an inlet (which is subjected to a tremendous shearing action that effects a time dispersion of uniform size) and an outlet.Mill (grinding)A mill is a device that breaks solid materials into smaller pieces by grinding,crushing,or cutting.Such comminution is an important unit operation in many processes.There are many different types of mills and many types of materials processed in them.Historically mills were powered by hand (e.g.via a hand crank),working animal (e.g.horse mill),wind or water ().

## Nanoparticle
A nanoparticle or ultrafine particle is usually defined as a particle of matter that is between 1 and 100 nanometres (nm) in diameter.The term is sometimes used for larger particles,up to 500 nm,[citation needed] or fibers and tubes that are less than 100 nm in only two directions.At the lowest range,metal particles smaller than 1 nm are usually called atom clusters instead.Ball Milling Material Milling,Jet Milling AVEKAIn ball milling,the desired particle size is achieved by controlling the time,applied energy,and the size and density of the grinding media.The optimal milling occurs at a critical speed.Ball mills can operate in either a wet or dry state.
