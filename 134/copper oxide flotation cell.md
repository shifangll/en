## The recovery of oxide copper minerals from a complex.
The oxide ore has a much higher grade than the mixed and sulphide ores but contributes less to the resource (Broughton et al.2002).The preferred method for the flotation of oxide and mixed copper ores is sulphidisation.The reagents are typically sodium sulphide (Na 2 S) and sodium hydrosulphide (NaHS).Slug sulphidisation,which uses a.Flotation2016 2 17&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;measure flotation cell hydrodynamic variables using high end optical equipment and software.By visualizing and understanding the “hidden” factors of flotation cell hydrodynamics,SGS Minerals Services has the expertise to provide you with reliable data and solutions for more efficient flotation.SULPHIDE FLOTATION
