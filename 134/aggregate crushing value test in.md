## DETERMINATION OF AGGREGATE CRUSHING VALUE
The aggregate crushing value gives a relative measure of the resistance of an aggregate to crushing under a gradually applied compressive load.Crushing value is a measure of the strength of the aggregate.The aggregates should therefore have minimum crushing value.3.RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN AGGREGATE CRUSHING VALUE (ACV.Hence weaker aggregates in construction industry may be rated accordingly.SIGNIFICANCE: The model developed for the relationship between aggregate crushing value (ACV) and ten percent fines aggregate crushing test (TFV) is useful in economics and safety perspective in the sense that time and money cost on site&nbsp;.

## Aggregate Crushing Value Test
Significance of Aggregate Crushing Value Test.The crushing value test is conducted on aggregates that are used for the construction of roads.Lower crushing value aggregates give much more durability for roads due to its lower crushed fraction under the compression load.The road is subjected to motion pressure continuously.AGGREGATE CRUSHING VALUEAGGREGATE CRUSHING VALUE 1.Objective The aggregate crushing value gives a relative measure of the resistance of an aggregate to crushing under a gradually applied compressive load.With aggregate of aggregate crushing value 30 or higher,the result may be anomalous,and in such cases the ten percent fines value should be determined instead.

## Aggregate crushing value of aggregates with cement.
An aggregate specimen is compacted into a steel cylinder fitted with a no friction plunger.The specimen is then loaded via the plunger.The load crushes the aggregate to an extent depending on the crushing resistance of the material.It is measured by a sieving test on the crushed specimen and it is a measure of the aggregate crushing value (ACV).aggregate crushing value (acv) NamiconUsed to determine aggregate impact value.Free fall of hammer during tests and built in blow counter.Complete with cylindrical measure dia.75 x 50 mm deep and steel tamping bar dia.16 mm x 600 mm long.Dimensions: diameter 250 x 480 (h) mm.Weight: 59 kg.Stainless steel made; air tight cover.60 ml approx.

## Aggregate crushing value test Step by Step Procedure …
Aggregate Crushing Value (ACV) can be determined by using a simple formula: This test is repeated once or twice and the average crushing value of the aggregate is determined.The average crushing value in the different tests is the actual crushing value of aggregate.Important points to rememberAggregate Crushing Value Calculator,Test on course …Calculate Aggregate Crushing Value.The ratio of the weight of fines formed to the total sample weight in each test shall be expressed as a percentage,the result being recorded to the first decimal place: Aggregate Crushing Value = W B W A &#215; 100.Where,W A is weight of surface dry sample

## BS 812 110:1990 Testing aggregates.Methods for determination.
29 Jun 1990.This British Standard,a part of the BS 812 series,describes a method for the determination of the aggregate crushing value (ACV) which gives a relative measure of the resistance of an aggregate to crushing under a gradually applied compressive load.The method is applicable to aggregates passing a&nbsp;.Importance Of Aggregate Crushing Value Testof 23.3%,Aggregate Impact Value (AIV) of 18.5% and water absorption of 0.54% while Granite Gneiss has 27.0%.The Aggregate Crushing Value is a value which indicates.passing through sieve 2.80mm BS sieve,formed in the test is.
