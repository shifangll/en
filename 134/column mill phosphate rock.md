## Phosphorite
Phosphorite,phosphate rock or rock phosphate is a non detrital sedimentary rock which contains high amounts of phosphate minerals.The phosphate content of phosphorite (or grade of phosphate rock) varies greatly,from 4% to 20% phosphorus pentoxide (P 2 O 5).Marketed phosphate rock is enriched (&quot;beneficiated&quot;) to at least 28%,often more than 30% P 2 O ‚Ä¶
