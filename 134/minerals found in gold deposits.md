## Gold Geoscience Australia
Gold is most often found in quartz rock.When quartz is found in gold bearings areas,it is possible that gold will be found as well.Quartz may be found as small stones in river beds or in large seams in hillsides.The white color of quartz makes it easy to spot in many environments.Geology Of Hard Rock Gold Deposits17&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Geology Of Hard Rock Gold Deposits.Previous Next.Many pyrite and pyrrhotite minerals contain gold,which is often recovered when extracting copper from lode vein deposits.The purity of gold is stated in terms of fineness and carats (ct).Fineness is defined as the parts per 1000.For example gold with a fineness of 800 means it is 80%.

## Geological and Geographical Characteristics of Gold …
Gold deposits are found in different types of rocks and geologic formations,falling into two mining categories: lode (primary) and placer (secondary).Lode deposits are contained within surrounding rock whereas placer deposits are dust particles contained in streams and stream beds.Geographically,gold can be found.Mesothermal Vein Gold Deposits30&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Much of the world's economic gold,silver,copper and lead zinc deposits are found in vein (lode) deposits.When veins occur in groupings—various discrete yet similar veins clustered in one area—it's referred to as a vein system.Vein systems can hold impressive amounts of valuable minerals.

## What other minerals metals can be found near gold …
27&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;What other metals can be found near a gold mine? I mean,Is it possible to have coal or silver deposits near a gold mine? What about things like diamonds and rubies? Also,in what kind of places do such mines exist? In extreme conditions? Or can they be discovered just anywhere? If there is a website that explains such things then that's even better.Thank Youuuuu =)Alluvial and Placer Mineral Deposits Geology for …Alluvial and Placer Mineral Deposits.Lis Sowerbutts Aug Last Updated: Octo.Minerals Found in Placers.In other places,most of the gold was in the alluvial deposits as in the Klondike Alaska Gold Rush and the California gold rushes of the 19th century.

## Minerals of Zimbabwe Ministry of Mines and Mining.
ECONOMIC MINERALS GOLD Gold mining and exploration in Zimbabwe has been going on from ancient times and it is estimated that a third (about 700 tonnes) of all historical gold production was mined locally from the seventh century until the introduction of mechanized mining methods with the arrival of Europeans about a century ago.The Geology of Gold Deposits15&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;The effort to understand the geology of gold was perhaps man's first serious effort at understanding the earth's rocks and minerals.Gold is actually a relatively scarce element on the crust of the earth,but it occurs in trace quantities spread throughout many different kinds of rocks and in many different geological environments.

## Veins and Hydrothermal Deposits
5&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Hydrothermal deposits are categorized according to the depth and temperature at which they formed.Veins are mineral deposits which form when a preexisting fracture or fissure within a host rock is filled with new mineral material.Ore minerals found may include native gold (Au); the sulfides galena (PbS),chalcopyrite.Gold Mineral PropertiesAlthough there are about twenty different gold minerals,all of them are quite rare.Therefore,most gold found in nature is in the form of the native metal.Gold occurs in hydrothermal veins deposited by ascending solutions,as disseminated particles through some sulfide deposits,and in placer deposits.

1&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Associated Minerals: Placer gold invariably is accompanied by other heavy minerals,which comprise the black,white,or yellow concentrates found in the sluice box when cleaning up.Table 3 lists these minerals roughly in the order of their commonness.Some of the characteristics noted under Remarks apply chiefly to the minerals as they are found in sluice box concentrates.Gold in porphyry copper deposits: its abundance and …Gold abundances in porphyry copper deposits vary greatly,complicating efforts to define gold rich porphyry copper deposits.The original definition was based on the Au Mo ratios of porphyry copper deposits with no reference to their copper content,and resulted in the suggestion that gold rich deposits were found largely in island arc regions (Kesler,1973).
