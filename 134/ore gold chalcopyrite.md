## Chalcopyrite
Gold is often associated with chalcopyrite in ore deposits,and efforts are therefore made at the mine to maximize the recovery of both gold and copper,either using a combination of gravity and flotation techniques or flotation alone.Using available techniques,some of the gold can be recovered directly as a gold concentrate,with,for.ChalcopyriteExamples of environments include sedimentary exhalative deposits and volcanogenic massive sulfide ore deposits.In addition to its aforementioned alternate names,chalcopyrite is one of two minerals that are commonly referred to as “fools gold.” Historically,it was the mineral upon which civilizations were built back in the Bronze Age.
