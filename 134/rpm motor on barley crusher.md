## mill How much torque is required to operate a barley
2019718&ensp&#0183&enspQuestion: How many inlbs or ftlbs of torque are required to crush barley using a mill such as the Barley Crusher? Motivation: I'm interested in motorizing my Barley Crusher.There are endless blogs entries and such on how to do this but the parts used often vary based on industrial salvage or the cheap motor of the week.Motorizing your Millpulley on a 1700 RPM motor and a 12″ pulley on the mill.Connecting the two with a V belt will provide about 425 RPM.(3 12 X 1700=425) Just about any size motor will operate the mill but 1 2 HP is probably ideal.Large pulleys with 3 8″ bores are hard to find so you will need to purchase reducers to accommodate the 3 8″ shaft on the mill.
