## Barite
Barite in construction.To produce barite concrete,the mineral does not require any particular colour or purity; nonetheless,any secondary characteristics,such as hardness and specific weight,make packaging the conglomerate very complex due to the high tendency of the mineral to crumble.bariteA dense mineral comprising barium sulfate [BaSO 4].Commonly used as a weighting agent for all types of drilling fluids,barites are mined in many areas worldwide and shipped as ore to grinding plants in strategic locations,where API specifies grinding to a particle size of 3 to74 microns.Pure barium sulfate has a specific gravity of 4.50 g cm 3,but drilling grade barite is expected to have.
