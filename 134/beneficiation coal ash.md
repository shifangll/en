## Coal Fly Ash Beneficiation
The present book deals with various,very significant topics of coal fly ash beneficiation,such as treatment of acid mine drainage with coal fly ash,toxic metal adsorption using coal fly ash,recovery of metals from coal fly ash and phytoreclamation of abandoned acid mine drainage site after treatment with coal fly ash,the status of research in coal fly ash utilization and applications and.SonoAsh LLCBECOME THE WORLD STANDARD FOR COAL ASH BENEFICIATION.At SonoAsh we envision a new coal ash industry structure.An industry that recognizes the full value of coal ash impoundments.With our patented technology,we can change the coal ash industry from a single use,one dimensional resource to the reality of a multi product matrix.

## Coal Beneficiation Technology
21&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Coal Beneficiation Coal beneficiation is a process by which the quality of raw coal is improved by either reducing the extraneous matter that gets extracted along with the mined coal or reducing the associated ash or both.Two basic processes of beneficiation: Dry deshaling: Non coal or shaly coal is removed without using any liquid media.Need For Coal Beneficiation and Use of Washery Rejects21&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Workshop on Clean Coal Technology Power Plants are designed for a particular Coal Quality range and deviation in quality adversely affects the performance and efficiency of the Plant.The key area of concern are: Ash in coal As high as 45%.Inconsistency in Quality of Coal.Chemical Quality Physical Quality.These issues can by and large be addressed by resorting to Coal beneficiation.
