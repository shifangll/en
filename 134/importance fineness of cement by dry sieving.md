8&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Fineness modulus is a single factor computed from the sieve analysis and is defined as the sum of the cumulative percentages retained on the sieve of the standard series divided by 100.The fineness modulus can be looked upon as a weighted average size or a sieve on which the material is retained,and the sieves being counted from the finest.Test To Check Fineness Of Cement Civil EngineeringFINENESS So we need to determine the fineness of cement by dry sieving as per IS: 4031 (Part 1) 1996The principle of this is that we determine the proportion of cement whose grain size is larger then specified mesh size
