## Iron ore pellets compressive strength prediction model based on.
To predict the key performance index (compressive strength) of Iron ore pellets.laid a foundation for the automatic control of the pellets compressive strength.What is the difference b w compressive strength and.Compressive strength is the load (measured in pounds sq.in.or sq.ft.) which the concrete (poured over a solid base) will support,without damage.Specifically,by being crushed.If the load gets large enough,the concrete will fracture and be crushed.The crush strength is the load (similarly.
