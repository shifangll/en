## Milling (machining) Wikipedia
Milling is the machining process of using rotary cutters to remove material from a workpiece by advancing (or feeding) the cutter into the workpiece at a certain direction.The cutter may also be held at an angle relative to the axis of the tool.Milling covers a wide variety of different operations and machines,on scales.Most of the industrial milling operations can be taken care of by 2.5 axis CNC.3 Axis Mill Machining Tutorial University of Idaho3 Axis Mill Machining Tutorial.and CATIA will update the machining operations appropriately.automatically selected the profile needed for the contour.
