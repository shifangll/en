## Ravensdown Gypsum (calcium sulphate)
Gypsum is used as a source of soluble calcium and sulphate,with the added advantage of not increasing soil pH (in contrast to lime as a calcium source) Gypsum is typically used in horticulture eg kiwifruit,apples and pipfruit production as well as for market gardeningAmmonium Sulfate Mosaic Crop NutritionAmmonium sulfate has an acidifying effect on soil due to the nitrification process,not from the presence of sulfate,which has a negligible effect on pH The acid producing potential of ammonium sulfate is greater than the same N application from ammonium nitrate,for example,since all of the N in ammonium sulfate converts to nitrate.
