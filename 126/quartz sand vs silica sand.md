## What is Frac Sand? A Durable Sand for Hydraulic Fracturing
What Is Frac Sand? "Frac sand" is a high purity quartz sand with very durable and very round grains It is a crush resistant material produced for use by the petroleum industry It is used in the hydraulic fracturing process (known as "fracking") to produce petroleum fluids,such as oil,natural gas,and natural gas liquids from rock units that lack adequate pore space for these fluids to flow.Properties of fused silica HeraeusAt first glance,quartz glass appears very simple,both chemically and structurally,since it is made from a single oxide component (silicon dioxide SiO 2) Chemical structure: Silica,as it is also known,is found throughout the earth’s crust However,only a small fraction has sufficient purity (>9998 %) to be suitable as raw material for quartz glass
