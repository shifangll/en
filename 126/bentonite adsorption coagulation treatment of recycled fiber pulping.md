## Additive and additivefree treatment technologies for pulp
Therefore,the bentonite adsorption and coagulation treatments were found to be efficient for recycled fiber pulp wastewater treatment,particularly due to its high capacity for the removal of large size particles and suspended colloidal substances like stickies from PPMW.Bentonite Adsorption &amp Coagulation Treatment of RecycledA bentonite &amp PAM particle flocculation system was employed in recycled fiber pulp wastewater treatment in this paper.The optimum conditions of the adsorption &amp coagulation treatment was explored and optimized and effects of the treatment were focused on,especially stickies substances removal.
