This is due to that raw materials and fuel fed to the cement burning process contains various amounts of secondary constituents such as chlorides,alkalis and sulphates.They are partially vaporized in the high temperature zone and condensed again in the colder temperature zone within the burning system.They therefore lead to form re circulating cycle which can be disturb the kiln operation.Cement WikipediaA cement plant consumes 3 to 6 GJ of fuel per tonne of clinker produced,depending on the raw materials and the process used.Most cement kilns today use coal and petroleum coke as primary fuels,and to a lesser extent natural gas and fuel oil.

## Cement Kiln Co Processing (High Temperature Treatment)
In the clinker burning process it is essential to maintain kiln charge material temperatures of approximately 1450°C and gas temperatures of up to 2000°C.Also,the clinker needs to be burned under oxidising conditions (IPPC,2007).Fuel and wastes fed through the main burner of a cement kiln will be decomposed under oxidising conditions in the primary flame burning zone at temperatures up.Available online a t www.pelagiaresearchlibrary.com.In the process of production of cement clinker in FCL,metal elements are mostly entered by primary raw materials:.during the burning process were determined.

PROCESSES AND TECHNOLOGY STATUS The manufacture of cement is a two phase process.Clinker is first produced in a kiln system from calcareous (limestone,chalk or marl) and argillaceous (clay or shale) materials,with addition,in some cases,of small amounts of corrective materials (sand,waste bauxite,iron ore).Various fossil fuels and waste fuels are used in this process to reach the.
