## compressive strength test Britannica.com
compressive strength test:.Brittle materials such as rock,brick,cast iron,and concrete may exhibit great compressive strengths; but ultimately they fracture.Notification requirements for concrete compressive.(1) The concrete in the footings,piers and walls and the mortar in masonry piers and walls has attained,on the basis of an appropriate ASTM standard test method of field cured samples,either 75 percent of the intended minimum compressive design strength or sufficient strength to support the loads imposed during steel erection.[Emphasis added.]
