If F = 1 the projection is a circle; the more the outline of the particle departs from circular,the smaller the value of F.By averaging the values of F derived from the two dimensional outlines of many particles,oriented randomly,an indication can be gained of the departure from sphericity of three dimensional particles.Some success has been achieved in correlating abrasive wear rates.Drilling fluid typesDrilling fluid service companies provide a wide range of additives that are designed to prevent or mitigate costly well construction delays.Examples of these products include: Lost circulation materials (LCM) that help to prevent or stop downhole mud losses into weak or …
