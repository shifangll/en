## Introduction to Mineral Processing
Lead Zinc Ore Lead and zinc often occur in the same ore.Copper is also present in some ores.Froth flotation is again employed to produce marketable concentrates of both.The process is identical in principle to the flotation of other minerals.The figure on theCopper Lead Concentrate SeparationThe separation of copper bearing from zinc sulphides is effected by two stage selective flotation,the zinc minerals being depressed and the copper minerals brought up in the first stage with reagents similar to those required in the lead flotation section of a lead

## Copper Sulfide Flotation
Copper Sulfide Flotation Circuit Beneficiation of Copper Sulfide by Flotation Copper,due to the present world demand and price,is of foremost interest to the mining industry.Many new properties are either in the process of being brought into production or areLead Zinc oresThe copper ions replace zinc atoms on the sphalerite surface creating a pseudocopper mineral surface coverage on the sphalerite which is then collected using copper flotation type collectors.Because most of the iron sulphides also report to the lead flotation tails and so feeds the zinc flotation circuit,typically lime is used to raise pH for iron sulphide depression.
