## COAL CHARACTERISTICS
coal is heated to 950 C (1,742 F) in the absence of air under specified conditions components of coal,except for moisture,which is liberated usually as a mixture of short &amp; long chain hydrocarbons.CoalCoal is a hard rock which can be burned as a solid fossil fuel.It is mostly carbon but also contains hydrogen,sulphur,oxygen and nitrogen.It is a sedimentary rock formed from peat,by the pressure of rocks laid down later on top.Peat,and therefore coal,is formed from the remains of plants which lived three thousand years ago in tropical.

## Energy density
Having a high energy density does not give information on how quickly this energy can be used.This knowledge is contained in a substance's power density,which describes the rate at which its energy can be put out.Typically having a high energy density goesEnergy Density of CoalCoal has a relatively high energy density of approximately 24 MJ kg.Energy density can be defined as the amount of energy per mass.Its SI units are J kg but MJ kg is more common.Eighty six percent of the coal burned in the United States is used by When.
