## Copper mining.Introduction.
Mining metals Metals are often found as compounds in ores.An ore is a rock or mineral that has enough metal in it to make it worth extracting.In the case of copper,it is worth extracting when there is about 2 kg of copper per 1000 kg of ore.Copper Mining and Processing: Processing of Copper Ores …Copper processing is a complicated process that begins with mining of the ore (less than 1% copper) and ends with sheets of 99.99% pure copper called cathodes,which will ultimately be made into products for everyday use.The most common types of ore,copper oxide and copper sulfide,undergo two different processes…
