## Beneficiation of Iron Ore
Low grade Iron Ore Beneficiation and the Process of Jigging Iron ore resources are getting consumed at an accelerated rate because of the growth in the production of iron and steel.Due to this reason the availability of high grade iron ore is reducing and the supply of high grade iron ore to iron and steel plants is declining sharply.How does the iron ore beneficiation process work?At its basic level,iron ore beneficiation consists of the following steps: 1.Crush and grind to a sufficiently fine size that the iron oxide minerals are broken free of the gangue minerals like silica (Liberation) 2.Physically sort the mineral.
