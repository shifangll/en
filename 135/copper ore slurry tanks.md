## How copper is made
The copper ore usually contains a large amount of dirt,clay,and a variety of non copper bearing minerals.The slurry of finely ground ore that emerges from the final ball mill contains particles about 0.01 in (0.25 mm) in diameter.where air is injected into the slurry through the bottom of the tanks.The chemical reagents make the.Gold CIL &amp; CIP Gold Leaching Process Explained CCD2&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;The gold cyanide complex is then extracted from the pulp or slurry by adsorption onto activated carbon.CIL stands for carbon in leach.This is a gold extraction process called cyanidation where carbon is added to the leach tanks (or reaction vessel) so that leaching and adsorption take place in the same tanks.
