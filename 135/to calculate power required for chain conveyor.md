## Conveyors
Horsepower required for conveyors transporting material on level ground: 1 hp (English horse power) = 745.7 W = 0.746 kW 1 ft (foot) = 0.3048 m = 12 in = 0.3333 yd Lifting Conveyors With lifting conveyors add lifting power from the chart below to the leveltorqueThere are other power losses associated with moving the belt,so incorporate a design margin into your final selection.If your conveyor is not level,then you also need to add the force required to lift the load against gravity to your calculation.
