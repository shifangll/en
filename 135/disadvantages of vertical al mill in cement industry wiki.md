## Cement Types,Composition,Uses and Advantages of.
We first discuss cement production and special nomenclature used by cement industrialists in expressing the composition of their cement products.We reveal different types of cement products,their compositions,properties,and typical uses.Wherever possible,we tend to give reasons as to why a particular cement type is more suitable for a given purpose than other types.Cement manufacturing.ManufacturingManufacturing the cement kiln Most Portland cement is made in a rotary kiln.Basically,this is a long cylinder rotating about its axis once every minute or two.The axis is inclined at a slight angle,the end with the burner being lower.The rotation causes the raw.
