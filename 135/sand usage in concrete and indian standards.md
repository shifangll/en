## What is the main purpose of sand in concrete making?
The strength of the concrete is inversely proportional to the water cement ratio.In other words,the more water you use to mix the concrete,the weaker the concrete mix.The less water you use to mix the concrete,the stronger the concrete mix.S.Concrete Mix Design As Per Indian Standard CodeConcrete Mix Design Introduction The process of selecting suitable ingredients of concrete and determining their relative amounts with the objective of producing a concrete of the required,strength,durability,and workability as economically as possible,is termed.
