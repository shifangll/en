## Epoxy Resin Glue
Usage: stick ceramics in the high temperature resistance occasion,such as outlet piping of coal mill in power plant,the inner of mill fan,dust remover system in steel plant,air duct elbow etc.Epoxy resin glue is the most reasonable and cost effective choice if you want to stick ceramics in steel,we will recommend the most suitable glue as per different application.Gear design and strength5.Gear design and strength Iupital has good strength,durability,wear resistance,and chemical resistance,so can be used to each gear.Gear wreck will happen because of its tooth fatigue and tooth surface wear,so strength design from both side is necessary.5.
