In coal fired power plants coal mills are used to pulverize and dry to coal before it is blown into the power plant furnace.The coal is feed into the coal mill through a central inlet pipe where gravity is used to lead the coal to the bottom of the mill,where the grinding table and some heavy rollers pulverizes the coal to particles.How steel pipe is madeThe first methods for producing steel pipe were introduced in the early 1800s,and they have steadily evolved into the modern processes we use today.In 1815,William Murdock invented a coal burning lamp system.Using a drop hammer,the edges folded together and welded.The pipe was finished by passing it through a groove and rolling mill.
