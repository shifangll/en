## copper extraction and purification
Copper can be extracted from non sulphide ores by a different process involving three separate stages: Reaction of the ore (over quite a long time and on a huge scale) with a dilute acid such as dilute sulphuric acid to produce a very dilute copper(II) sulphateIron Ore Solutions Veolia Australia and New ZealandThe iron ore sector is a significant part of Australia’s mining and manufacturing industry and while success for many clients comes in increasing operational efficiency of iron ore mining and processing facilities,we also understand success comes in minimising the.

## Mineral processing
Automated Ore Sorting Modern,automated sorting applies optical sensors (visible spectrum,near infrared,X ray,ultraviolet),that can be coupled with electrical conductivity and magnetic susceptibility sensors,to control the mechanical separation of ore into two.Copper extractionCopper extraction refers to the methods used to obtain copper from its ores.The conversion of copper consists of a series of physical and electrochemical processes.Methods have evolved and vary with country depending on the ore source,local environmental regulations,and other factors.As in all mining operations,the ore must usually be.
