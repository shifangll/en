## Zinc: smelting,producing and classification Metalpedia
Zinc smelting is the process of converting zinc concentrates (ores that contain zinc) into pure zinc.The most common zinc concentrate processed is zinc sulfide,which is obtained by concentrating sphalerite using the froth flotation method.There are two methods of smelting zinc: the pyrometallurgical process and the hydrometallurgical process (over 90% of hydrometallurgical process is in.Zinc processingZinc processing Zinc processing Ores: Zinc ores are widely distributed throughout the world,although more than 40 percent of the world’s output originates in North America and Australia.The common zinc containing minerals are the zinc sulfide known as zinc blende or sphalerite (ZnS),a ferrous form of zinc blende known as marmatite [(ZnFe)S],and a zinc carbonate known as calamine or.
