Copper slag is generated out of copper concentrate while extracting copper in the copper smelting units.It is composed of ferrosilicate material and oxide when the slag is quenched in the cold water.This process makes the slag into a granule form resultingRecovery of Copper from Reverberatory Copper Slag and …because copper slag has a bond work index of 22 kWh t and is thus a very hard slag.The process also has reduced flotation recoveries and requires high flotation reagent consumption.The present work shows that digestion of the milled copper slag slurry with
