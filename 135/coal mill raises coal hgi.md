## Hardgrove Grindability Index
Hardgrove Grindability Index (short HGI) is a measure for the grindability of coal.Grindability is an index,therefore it has no unit.The smaller the HGI,the harder is coal texture and less grindable is the coal.Grindability is an important factor for the design a coal mill.PPT PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS OF COAL MILLS …A curve linking HGI and mill capacity provides information on mill performance with that coal.A curve linking moisture content of the coal with mill capacity shows what reduction in capacity will arise if the moisture is excessive.This is particularly important with ball mills.The particle size distribution and top size may be of importance.
