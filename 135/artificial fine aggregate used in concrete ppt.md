## Aggregates for Concrete Portland Cement Association
Aggregates for Concrete.The proper selection of aggregates for use in concrete mixtures is critical to long term concrete performance.Aggregates generally occupy 60% to 75% of the concrete volume and strongly influence the concrete’s fresh and hardened properties,mixture proportions,and economy.Pavement materials: AggregatesOverview RYAN Aggregate is a collective term for the mineral materials such as sand,gravel,and crushed stone that are used with a binding medium (such as water,bitumen,Portland cement,lime,etc.) to form compound materials (such as bituminous concrete and Portland cement concrete).

## 4 Aggregate Specifications and Requirements
Organic impurities are the only concern in fine aggregates.Section 904.02 places a restriction for fine aggregate for use in portland cement concrete and mortar.No restrictions are placed on organic impurities in fine aggregate for use in other types of construction.The limitations on the amount of organic impurities allowed in fine aggregatesFunctions and requirements of ingredients of cement concrete · Aggregate: In the cement concrete,to provide good quality of concrete aggregate is used in two size groups: · Fine aggregate (sand) particle size less than 4.75mm · Coarse aggregate Particle size more than 4.75mm.Fine aggregate (sand) …
