Decision: Escort Vesna or not Consequences: If you escort her,you get the option to rendezvous with her at the mill at night.If you marchito not help her,the bandits kill her.Reference:She's No Early Bird Racist encounter[edit edit source] Decision: Help Zoltan Consequences: If you marchWho can you plough?,page 4&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;But frankly I preferred the love cards in TW1,the ploughing animations are always identical while the love cards were different and nicely done.They should have put some more effort when designing the ploughing scenes,put some humor in it (like in the She's No Early Bird quest in TW1,when Geralt is ploughing Vesna in the mill,lol).
