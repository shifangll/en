## Rolling processes
Rolling processes 5 1 introduction: Rolling is the process of reducing the thickness or changing the cross section of a long workpiece by compressive forces applied through a set of rolls,as shown in figure (5 1).Fig.(5 1) Most rolling is carried out by hot working,called hot rolling,owing to the large aUsing the eight roller mill in the purifier less mill flow20&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;In order to study the effect of 1R roll gap (parameter A),2R roll gap (parameter B) and sieve aperture (parameter C),as well as their interactions,on flour release and flour ash content in the process with the eight roller mill,a factorial design (3 3) was used.The model resulted in 27 different combinations of experiment (Table 2).
