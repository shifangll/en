## Molybdenum Processing
Flotation separates the metallic minerals from the gangue this way and in the case of copper molybdenum ores separates molybdenite from copper sulphide.The resulting MoS 2 concentrate contains between 85% and 92% MoS 2.Further treatment by acid leaching can be used to dissolve impurities like copper and lead if necessary.Molybdenum: mining and processing MetalpediaMolybdenite can occur as the sole mineralization in an ore body,but is usually associated with the sulphide minerals of other metals,mainly copper.Molybdenum mines are classified into three groups according to the minerals contained in the ore body and their quality: •Primary mines,where the extraction of molybdenite is the sole aim.

## COPPER Copper production
Separation of special copper ores such as those containing molybdenite or with high zinc or lead content (Canada) is also possible by flotation methods.Flotation of non sulfide copper minerals is rare because these ores are mostly subjected tocopperMolybdenite2020 2 17&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Molybdenite occurs in high temperature hydrothermal ore deposits.Its associated minerals include pyrite,chalcopyrite,quartz,anhydrite,fluorite,and scheelite.Important deposits include the disseminated porphyry molybdenum deposits at Questa,New Mexico and the Henderson and Climax mines in Colorado.Molybdenite also occurs in porphyry copper deposits of Arizona,Utah,and Mexico.

## Copper Molybdenum ores
Copper Molybdenum ores Molybdenite (MoS 2) is the predominant economic molybdenum mineral.While naturally very hydrophobic and can effectively be ﬂoated with just frother,addition of a hydrocarbon oil extender enhances its recovery.Making very pure moly concentrate grades is necessary for lubricant and oil additive applications so theCOREMolybdenite is a valuable by product in copper flotation.Driven by economic considerations,the recovery of molybdenite from low grade porphyry copper ores has become of great interest in the last decade.

## Molybdenite
Molybdenite is a mineral of molybdenum disulfide,MoS2.Similar in appearance and feel to graphite,molybdenite has a lubricating effect that is a consequence of its layered structure.The atomic structure consists of a sheet of molybdenum atoms sandwiched between sheets of sulfur atoms.The Mo S bonds are strong,but the interaction between.A novel approach for preferential flotation recovery of.There are several flow sheets (listed in Fig.1a and b) used in the flotation recovery of copper and molybdenum from their porphyry sulfide ores.Fig.1a is a typical flow sheet that consists of two stages (Raghavan and Hsu,1984,Bulatovic,2007,Liu et al.2011).The first stage,commonly known as the copper circuit,produces a bulk copper sulfide molybdenum sulfide concentrate.
