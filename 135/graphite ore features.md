## Graphite
Detailed description,properties,and locality information guide about the mineral graphite.Graphite is rather common mineral,but fine crystals are rare.Most Graphite mining areas produce enormous quantities from a single or several large Graphite veins,but collector specimens in good crystals are not commonly encountered.GraphiteGraphite is made using the Furnace II or Furnace III using coal.It is used in the production of steel ingots or can be ground in the alchemical mill for graphite powder.In order to craft graphite you'll need the Advanced Smelting and Precious Metals technology.
