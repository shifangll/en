## Solvay Process to Make Sodium Carbonate
Solvay Process majorly used in sodium carbonate industrial production was discovered by belgian industrial chemist Ernest Solvay which uses three readily available materials salt brine,limestone,ammonia Sodium carbonate (Na 2 CO 3) is found naturally or is manufactured from natural salt i.e.sodium chloride (common salt).Synthesis of sodium bicarbonate PrepChemPreparation of sodium bicarbonate 60g of powdered sodium chloride are added to 180g of a 10% aqueous solution of ammonia and the mixture is allowed to stand,with occasional swirling.

## CHEM GUIDE: Sodium carbonate: Manufacture,properties,
Sodium carbonate is usually made by the Ammonia soda process or Solvay process The raw materials for this process are common salt,ammonia and limestone (for supplying CO 2 and quicklime) When carbon dioxide is passed into a concentrated solution of brine saturated with ammonia,ammonium bicarbonate is producedSodium Carbonate (Soda Ash) SolvayThe majority of sodium carbonate produced in the United States is used by the glass industry,detergent industry or in manufacturing other chemicals
