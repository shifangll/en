## Basalt
The most striking difference between mare basalt and terrestrial basalt is in their contents of volatile species.Besides H 2 O (practically unmeasurable in most lunar rocks),this disparity is manifested by data for volatile alkalies (sodium,potassium,rubidium,and caesium) and by trace metals such as zinc,indium,bismuth,and cadmium (Figure 6).Igneous Rocks: Everything You Need to KnowIgneous rocks (derived from the Latin word for fire,ignis) can have very different mineral backgrounds,but they all share one thing in common: they formed by the cooling and crystallization of a melt.This material may have been lava erupted at the Earth's surface,or magma (unerupted lava) at depths of up to a few kilometers,known as magma in deeper bodies.
