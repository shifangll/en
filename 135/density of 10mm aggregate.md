RE: differences in concrete properties using 10mm to 20mm aggregate BigH (Geotechnical) 21 Dec 14 11:17 Ron as you know,on a mass concrete dam,that is always our worry the heat of hydration and density of concrete not so much regarding strength except on spillwaysWhat is the density of sand in kg m3? AnswersDrivecoarse aggregate.Natural mineral aggregates,i.e.sand and gravel have a bulk density of 95 to 105 lbs ft3 (1520 1680 kg m3) and produce Normal Weight concrete (NWC).Aggregates with bulk densities less than 70 lbs ft3 (1120 Kg m3) are called Lightweight.

## Specific Gravity of Coarse Aggregates: Its Importance,
As per the definition given in the ‘IS: 2386 (Part III) 1963’,(Indian Standard Methods of Test for Aggregates for Concrete Specific Gravity,Density,Voids,Absorption and Bulking),the specific gravity of coarse aggregates is the weight of the aggregates dried to constant weight in an oven at 100&#176;C divided by its absolute volume including the natural voids within the aggregate.Concrete Aggregates Boral3&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Coarse Aggregate is normally greater than 5mm.Fine Aggregate is aggregate less than 5mm.Can be a single sized material typically 20mm,14mm,10mm,or 7mm or a graded aggregate consisting of a blend of single sized aggregate.Concrete Aggregates are produced to Australian Standards (AS 2758) or to more specific customer requirements.
