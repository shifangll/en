## A method to determine the grinding wheel’s topography.
A method for determining the topographic characteristics of a grinding wheel is developed based on acoustic emission (AE) technology.For implementing the procedure,an AE monitoring system was integrated in the CNC of a grinding machine in order to detect a precise reference position on the grinding wheel’s periphery,allowing an AE online.Grinding Wheel BalancersAutomatic grinding wheel balancing head by SBS.As a world leader in the manufacture of automatic grinding wheel balancers SBS offer dynamic balancing systems and acoustic emission monitoring instruments to fit any grinding machine.

## Archiwa: Grinding wheels for steel,alloys and noble.
With a thickness of 0.7 mm,they operate with a minimum of dust emissions;.highly efficient,strong and flexible grinding wheels; for cutting steel,alloys.What We Do Accretech SBSIn order for the wheel of a grinding machine to accurately cut,produce smooth surface finishes,and generate correct part geometry,it is necessary to prevent vibration in the grinding process.A primary cause of vibration during grinding is the existence of imbalance in the grinding wheel.(acoustic emission or AE) generated by the.
