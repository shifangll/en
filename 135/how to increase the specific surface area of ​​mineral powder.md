## Specific surface area
Specific surface area (SSA) is a property of solids defined as the total surface area of a material per unit of mass,(with units of m 2 kg or m 2 g) or solid or bulk volume (units of m 2 m 3 or m −1).It is a physical value that can be used to determine the type and.How to disperse and stabilize pigmentsThe surface area of the pigment also affects the level of dispersant used,and in general,if too little is used then the full benefits will not be realized.If too much is used,it can be shown that the thickness of the protective barrier is actually reduced as a result of overcrowding on the pigment surface.
