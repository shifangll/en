## Segregation of Concrete
Segregation of concrete is the separation of cement paste and aggregates of concrete from each other during handling and placement.Segregation also occurs due to over vibration or compaction of concrete,in which cement paste comes to the top and aggregates settles at the bottom.Segregation in Aggregate Base StockpilesSegregation in Aggregate Base Stockpiles Aggregate base is placed between the compacted subgrade and the concrete or AC surface layer to provide support and drainage.It is composed approximately 50% coarse and 50% fine aggregate,and its tight.
