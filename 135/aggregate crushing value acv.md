2.16 The aggregate crushing value is the ratio of the mass of fines formed by the crushing process to the total.Report the mean as the ACV unless the individual results differ by more than 0.07 times the mean value.In this case repeat the test on two further specimens,calculate the median of the four results to the nearest whole number.Quantifying the Role of Coarse Aggregate Strength on.From the tests characterizing the aggregate point and bulk strength results,the Aggregate Crushing Value (ACV) test and its surrogate parameters were found to correlate well with performance.The compressive strength obtained using the Schmidt hammer seems to be the most appropriate

## Methods for determination of aggregate crushing value …
the aggregate crushing value (ACV) which gives a relative measure of the resistance of an aggregate to crushing under a gradually applied compressive load.The method is applicable to aggregates passing a 14.0 mm test sieve and retained on a 10.0 mm test sieve.For other size fractions,there is another recommended method.Aggregate ImpactTable 5.4 presents the statistical data of the LA abrasion mass loss,aggregate crushing value (ACV) and aggregate impact value (AIV) obtained from 307 RA samples.As expected,the LA abrasion results suggest that the resistance to fragmentation of RA,in descending order,is RCA,MRA and RMA.However,this trend is not clear in the case of AIV and ACV.
