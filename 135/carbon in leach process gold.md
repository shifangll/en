The solubilized gold is simultaneously adsorbed onto coarse granules of activated carbon directly in the pulp in the so called Carbon In Leach process (CIL).The loaded carbon is treated at high temperature to elute the adsorbed gold into the solution once again.Modeling of the carbon in pulp (CIP) CiteSeerXby activated coconut carbon is a well proven process widely used to recover gold from slurry at cyanide leaching plants.In this research,modelling of adsorption of dissolved gold performed by using real CIP (carbon in pulp) plant data.For this aim,five kinetic models and the gold mass balance calculations were used&nbsp;.
