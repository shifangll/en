## Introduction to Milling Tools and Their Application
Introduction to Milling Tools and their Application Identification and application of cutting tools for milling The variety of cutting tools available for modern CNC milling centers makes it imperative for machine operators to be familiar with different types of milling cutters and how they are applied to everyday milling processes.Ramping: Two axis linear and circularWhat is successful ramping? Linear ramping is a commonly used,efficient way of approaching the workpiece when machining closed slots pockets cavities,and it eliminates the need for a drill.Linear ramping is defined as simultaneous feeding in the axial direction (Z) and in one radial direction (X or Y),i.e.two axes ramping.
