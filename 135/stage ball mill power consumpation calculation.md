## Calculation of energy required for grinding in a ball mill
The grinding product size,P,in a Bond ball mill,which is given by the aperture size which passes 80% of the grinding product as a function of the aperture size of the test screen P k,can be expressed by the formula P= P k K 2.The power consumption calculation of a ball drum millThe methods of power consumption calculation are developed for a tube mill with cross longitudinal motion of the grinding elements,which takes into account the capacity of the mill with a vertical.
