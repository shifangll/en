## Importance of phosphate pock application for sustaining …
Phosphorus is one of the essential nutrients required for plant growth.Although it is moderately available in nature,it is a deficient nutrient in most soils especially calcareous soils.Phosphate rock (PR) is considered the cheapest P fertilizer.Phosphate rock sources may be of igneous or sedimentary origin.In Egypt,the natural phosphate rock is located in Sebaiya (Nile Valley),Safaga.Triple Superphosphate Mosaic Crop NutritionTriple Superphosphate Triple superphosphate (TSP) was one of the first high analysis phosphorus (P) fertilizers that became widely used in the 20th century.Technically,it is known as calcium dihydrogen phosphate and as monocalcium phosphate,[Ca(H₂PO₄)₂.H₂O].Despite its excellent history as a P source,its use has declined as other P fertilizers have become more popular.
