## Gold Mining with Cyanide
Gold Mining with Cyanide REPORT ON I Repeal of the Ban on Cyanide Heap Leaching in Gold Mining WHAT IS CYANIDE AND WHAT DOES IT DO IN THE ENVIRONMENT Cyanide is a general term,referring to various specific cyanide compounds.Cyanide (CN) itself is a simple,organic anion (negatively charged ion) consisting of carbon and nitrogen.How is cyanide used in gold mining?Cyanidation is used to extract gold from a finely ground ore material in a mix with water at about 55% solids by mass.Gold extraction is always a surface processing based extraction process and has nothing to do with the process of Mining itself.

## Sodium cyanide
7&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Used in: gold mining for extraction of gold from ore,in steel cyanation,in electroplating,hydrometallurgy of precious metals,in floatation processes and for beneficiation of metallic ores.Form: Solid sodium cyanide is produced to form a white crystalline highly soluble briquettes or ‘cyanoid’.Should cyanide still be used in modern day mining?The concentration of cyanide used in processing is very diluted.Toxic sodium cyanide has been used in gold mining since 1887,and it remains the primary reagent in use for gold processing today because it allows for efficient extraction of gold from low grade ore.

## EARTHWORKS Cyanide Use in Gold Mining Cyanide
How is cyanide used in mining A sodium cyanide solution is commonly used to leach gold from ore.There are two types of leaching: Heap leaching: In the open,cyanide solution is sprayed over huge heaps of crushed ore spread atop giant collection pads.The cyanide dissolves the gold from the ore into the solution as it&nbsp;.gold processing Britannica.comHowever,gold is readily dissolved in a number of solvents,including oxidizing solutions of hydrochloric acid and dilute solutions of sodium cyanide.The colonization of South and Central America that began during the 16th century resulted in the mining and refining of gold in the New World before its transferal to Europe;&nbsp;.
