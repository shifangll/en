higher lime content in the high silica iron ore compared to the case with a low silica ore.If the amount of ores assimi lated for the two cases is low then the melt generated from the high silica ore mixture will have a higher basicity.But as more ores areUtilization of iron ore tailings as fine aggregate in.Natural sand and iron ore tailings were used as aggregates.The natural sand was originally excavated from the lower reaches of Yangtze River and had an apparent density of 2.63 g cm 3.The tailings were obtained from the local iron and steel industry and had an apparent density of 2.62 g cm 3.The chemical composition of the tailings is shown in Table 1.

## Vale Quartz project uses sand from iron ore mine tailings.
The Executive Director of Sustainability and Institutional Relations,Luiz Eduardo Osorio,participated on June 7 in the launch of the Vale Quartz Project,an initiative that uses quartz (silica) sand in iron ore mining tailings to replace natural quartz in the production of quartz surfaces,engineered stone products that are an alternative to marble and granite.Iron ore markets digest impact of Vale tailings dam disaster · Vale’s CFO Luciano Siani said in a conference call with analysts late March that the miner’s average iron ore product mix was set to decline in terms of quality following the January 25 dam burst.“With lower levels of wet (ore) processing,production of higher value added products falls and so we need more high quality Carajas ore for.

## Optimisation of MgO addition in low and high silica iron.
The quality of iron ore sinter mainly depends on sinter mineralogy,which in turn depends on the chemical composition of the sinter mix.The reduction properties of the mineral phases formed in the sinter influences the sinter reducibility.MgO has a varying effect on sinter reducibility at different silica contents.Tryex Ore & MineralsTryex Ore & Minerals is one of the largest IRON ORE reserves in the Western Hemisphere of over 21,000 Acres Copper Titanium Vanadium & Silica Sand
