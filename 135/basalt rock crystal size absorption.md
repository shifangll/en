## The Density of Common Rocks and Minerals
The specific densities of the most common rocks and minerals,with a look at porosity.metals are generally denser than rocks.This range of densities can also be attributed to a rock's porosity (the amount of open space between mineral grains).This is measured.What size is basalt crystalsCrystal size in these rock types is determined by their rate of cooling.Pegmatites have large crystals due to very slow cooling.Obsidian has microscopic crystals due to almost instantaneous cooling.
