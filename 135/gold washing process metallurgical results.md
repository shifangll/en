## Leaching (metallurgy)
Leaching is a process widely used in extractive metallurgy where ore is treated with chemicals to convert the valuable metals within into soluble salts while impurity remain insoluble.These can then be washed out and processed to give the pure metal; the material left over is commonly referred to as tailings.Washing Activated CarbonIn the process of washing activated carbon,a dilute hydrochloric acid solution (3%) is circulated pumped into the elution column.The acid dissolves inorganic foulants such as calcium carbonate,magnesium and sodium salts,fine ore Minerals such as silica,and.
