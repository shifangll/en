Ball Mill.We bring forth a highly advanced Ball Mill,specifically engineered for both wet as well as dry cement grinding applications.Classified depending on the circuit design,bearing,grinding type and drive,the selection is made on the basis of the product fineness,quality,and nature of raw material,site conditions and specific requirements.ComminutionComminution is the reduction of solid materials from one average particle size to a smaller average particle size,by crushing,grinding,cutting,vibrating,or other processes.In geology,it occurs naturally during faulting in the upper part of the Earth's crust.In industry,it is an important unit operation in mineral processing,ceramics,electronics,and other fiel

## Autogenous and Semi Autogenous Mills
AG SAG mills can accomplish the same size reduction work as two or three stages of crushing and screening,a rod mill,and some or all of the work of a ball mill.Because of the range of mill sizes available,AG SAG milling can often be accomplished with fewer lines than in a conventional rod mill ball circuit.All of the above contributes toAMIT 135: Lesson 8 Rod Mills Mining Mill Operator TrainingUsed as the primary comminution unit in a grinding circuit.Rods are placed parallel along the length of the rod mill.Rods are 150mm shorter than the mill length.Breakage occurs more from cascading than cateracting.The product size distribution is narrower than a ball mill but significantly coarser.Most are overflow discharge type.
