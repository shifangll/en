## Grinding (abrasive cutting) Wikipedia
Electrochemical grinding is a type of grinding in which a positively charged workpiece in a conductive fluid is eroded by a negatively charged grinding wheel.The pieces from the workpiece are dissolved into the conductive fluid.A schematic of ELID grinding.Electrolytic in process dressing (ELID) grinding is one of the most accurate grinding methods.In this ultra precision grinding.Electrochemical Grinding Theory and Application Springerelectrochemical grinding process 2 Electrochemical Grinding.depending on the workpiece material ground and the size and concentration of the abrasive grains on the grinding wheel.In addition,the heat produced by the ECG process is very low,resulting in less distortion of the workpiece.The performance of this process depends on both conventional grinding and anodic dissolu tion parameters.
