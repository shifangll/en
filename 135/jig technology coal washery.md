## What is Coal Washing?
Coal washing is a process that is undertaken in a coal washery or coal preparation plant (CPP) where coal is refined or cleaned of impurities.Coal washing involves using water,mechanical techniques and relies on gravity and the difference of density between coal and it's impurities which are usually more densely packed due to the fact that.CCL Central Coalfields Limited A Miniratna …Rajrappa Washery Rajrappa Washery was commissioned in 1987 constructed by M S MAMC.Its installed capacity is 3.0MTY of raw coal feed which is highest in India as coking coal Washery.It is based on Jig washing technology.
