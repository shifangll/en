## What is the working principle of a wind turbine?
Wind turbines operate on a simple principle.The energy in the wind turns two or three propeller like blades around a rotor.The rotor is connected to the main shaft,which spins a generator to create electricity.Click on the image to see an anim.SeismometerA seismometer is an instrument that responds to ground motions,such as caused by earthquakes,volcanic eruptions,and explosions.Seismometers are usually combined with a timing device and a recording device to form a seismograph.[1] The output of such a device—formerly recorded on paper (see picture) or film,now recorded and processed.
