## Steel Slag
The primary applications for steel slag in the United States are its use as a granular base or as an aggregate material in construction applications.Disposal.While most of the furnace slag is recycled for use as an aggregate,excess steel slag from other operations (raker,ladle,clean out,or pit slag) is usually sent to landfills for disposal.Blast Furnace SlagBlast furnace slag is a nonmetallic coproduct produced in the process.It consists primarily of silicates,aluminosilicates,and calcium alumina silicates.The molten slag,which absorbs much of the sulfur from the charge,comprises about 20 percent by mass of iron production.Figure 3 1 presents a general schema

## Optimization of mill performance by using
16&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Mill power Usually,plant operators use mill power readings as an indicator of ball filling degree and,often,try to keep it at the maximum level.It is well known that the mill absorbed power depends on operating parameters other than ball level,such as pulp density and liner configuration.Figure 2 shows that there is no linear relation betweenSlag Grinding Mill,Slag Grinding PlantTo make slag into powder,to processing slag,we have slag grinding mill which can also be called slag grinding equipment,slag pulverizer,slag micronizer.There are five types of Shanghai CLIRIK Slag grinding mill grinding equipment,they are HGM80,HGM90,HGM100,HGM100A and HGM125.

## What are the advantages and characteristics of slag.
Vertical mill has widely application in the field of slag,coal mine,cement,non metallic mineral and other industries,Guilin Hong Cheng produced slag vertical grinding mill has many advantages and characteristics to solve the ordinary mill low production,high energy consumption,and high maintenance cost problems with its advanced process,is the ideal choice for processing slag.SlagSlag is the glass like by product left over after a desired metal has been separated (i.e.smelted) from its raw ore.Slag is usually a mixture of metal oxides and silicon dioxide.However,slags can contain metal sulfides and elemental metals.While slags are generally used to remove waste in metal smelting,they can also serve other purposes,such as assisting in the temperature control of.
