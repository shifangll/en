## List Common Oxide Minerals
Manganese is added in small quantities to ordinary steel up to 1%; more than this makes the steel brittle; but when the amount of manganese is increased to 7%,the properties of Hadfield steel begin to appear.Ferro manganese is an alloy of iron and manganese,containing from 40% to 80% manganese; it is used in making manganese steel.FRANKLINITE (Zinc Iron Manganese Oxide)Franklinite is one of the minerals found at Franklin,New Jersey,a world famous locality that has produced many formerly unknown and exotic mineral species.It is found in large enough quantity to serve as a ore of zinc and manganese,two important strategic and industrial metals.

## Umber Wikipedia
Umber is a natural brown or reddish brown earth pigment that contains iron oxide and manganese oxide.Umber is darker than the other similar earth pigments,ochre and sienna.In its natural form,it is called raw umber.When heated (calcinated),the color becomes more intense,and …manganese oxide Sigma AldrichSummary: This gene is a member of the iron manganese superoxide dismutase family.It encodes a mitochondrial protein that forms a homotetramer and binds one manganese ion per subunit.This protein binds to the superoxide byproducts of oxidative phosphorylation and converts them to hydrogen peroxide and diatomic oxygen.
