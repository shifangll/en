## prediction of grinding media wear in sag mills
prediction of grinding media wear in sag mills Grinding Media Growth Steel Optimising the charge motion to ensure grinding media is hitting the toe of the charge will result in the maximising of ore breakage rates and therefore mill throughput.Process Response ModelingProcess Response Modeling Liberation analysis is a powerful tool to gain insight into the mineralogy of an ore and how this may affect metallurgical processing.However,in some cases more detailed investigation of a particular aspect of process mineralogy is required to improve understanding of,for instance,realistic grades and recovery that can be expected.
