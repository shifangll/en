## Modeling and simulation of a fully air swept ball mill in.
This paper is concerned with the model of a fully air swept ball mill operating in a raw material grinding circuit.For simplicity,the approach assumes that different components in the feed can be tBoilersPulverized coal boilers fire finely powdered coal,typically with an average particle size of about 25 &#181;m (0.001 in).Coal burns in suspension,like the combustion in an oil or gas fired boiler.Coal is pulverized in some type of large mill Pulverized coal is fired out into the furnace volume using burners that l
