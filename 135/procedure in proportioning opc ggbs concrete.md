## Sustainable Studies on Concrete with GGBS As a Replacement,
Test Specimens and Test Procedure 150 mm concrete cubes and cylinders of 150 mm diameter and 300 mm length were used as test specimens to determine the compressive strength of concrete and split tensile strength of concrete for both cases (ie,normal concrete and GGBS concrete) The ingredients of concrete were thoroughly mixed tillProportioning of concrete mixCONCRETE MIX PROPORTIONING • Determination of the proportion of the concrete ingredients such as cement,fine aggregate,coarse aggregate,water and admixtures is called concrete mix.• A proper mix design only can gives the specified properties such as workability,strength,permeability and durability with economy.

## (PDF) RELATION AMONG MECHANICAL PROPERTIES OF GROUND,
Swamy and Bouikni [13] reported that,by a proper mix proportioning,GGBS concrete can be produced with strengths comparable to those with OPC from 3rd day onwards Authors proposed that the total cementitious material is to be increased by 10% for 50% replacement of OPC by GGBS,and by 20% for 65% replacement to attain strengths comparable to.Partial Replacement of Cement with GGBS in Concrete50% for GGBS concrete respectively for M20 grade concrete of OPC cement and crushed sand.This report shows that tensile strength also gives good performance for 20%,30 % and 40% replacement which is more than normal plain concrete.

The control of fresh and hardened properties of fly ash GGBS concrete through a suitable mix design procedure is still desired Reaction processes and products are completely different from those of Portland cement,and the empirical procedures usually adopted for the mix design of PC concretes cannot be used for AACStudy on Geopolymer Concrete using GGBSgranulated blast furnace slag (GGBS) in concrete mixes to overcome these problems.This paper presents the workability study of concrete with GGBS as a replacement material for cement without the addition of Super plasticizer.Concrete grades of M.

## principles of concrete mix designppt ACC Help
Concrete mix design is defined as the appropriate selection and proportioning of constituents to produce a concrete with pre defined characteristics in the fresh and hardened stat In general,concrete mixes are designed in order to achieve a defined workability,strength and durability The selection and proportioning of materials depend on: 34A Study on Compatibility of Super Plasticizers with GGBS,concrete [1] Ground granulated blast furnace slag is similar to ordinary cement along with fineness,setting time,soundness and strength It is recognized that the rate of hardening of GGBS in mortar or concrete is somewhat slower than that of Ordinary Portland cement during first 28,

Another major hurdle of extensive use of GGBS concrete lies in the little source of supply of GGBS.As Hong Kong is not a major producer of steel,GGBS as a by product of steel has to be imported overseas and this introduces higher material cost due toConsiderations of Sustainability in the Mixture …&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;The mixture proportioning of concrete for sustainability should consider four aspects,without sacrificing affordability: the lowering of the carbon dioxide emi Title: Considerations of Sustainability in the Mixture Proportioning of Concrete for Strength and Durability.
