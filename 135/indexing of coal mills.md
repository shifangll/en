Coal ball mill is a machine that crushes and grinds the coal briquette into pulverized coal It is important auxiliary equipment of pulverized coal furnace During the coal grinding process,the coal is crushed and its superficial area increases continually To add new superficial area,the bond between solid molecules must be overcome,so the energy is consumed The coal is grinded into.Coal mill,Coal grinding mill,Crushing mill,Coal powder.In coal fired power plants coal mills are used to pulverize and dry to coal before it is blown into the power plant furnace.The coal is feed into the coal mill through a central inlet pipe where gravity is used to lead the coal to the bottom of the mill,where the grinding table and some heavy rollers pulverizes the coal to particles.
