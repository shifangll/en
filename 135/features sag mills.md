## Autogenous and Semi Autogenous Mills
Some dry autogenous mills operating in Canada are 8.5 m in diameter and 1.5 m in length.These are known as Aerofall mills.The Cadia Hill (Australia) wet SAG mill is 12.2 m in diameter with a 20 MW motor and in 2004 was thSAG Mill Grinding Circuit DesignSAG and AG Mills operate by lifting ore grinding media and dropping it on the operating bed of the mill charge.High impacts from lifting ore and media promote impact breakage which is the primary mechanism for size reduction in the mill.

AG SAG mills can accomplish the same size reduction work as two or three stages of crushing and screening,a rod mill,and some or all of the work of a ball mill.Because of the range of mill sizes available,AG SAG milling can often be accomplished withSAG Mill Process ControlUnderground mines are an example: the hoisting capacity of the mine shaft is the rate limiting step in the process,and the SAG mill must adapt to what the shaft can supply.So yes,there are situations where constant tonnage is appropriate; but most SAG mill operat

## Canada’s four newest gold mines
&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;The mills act as big centrifuges,forcing heavy gold particles to the outside,where they work their way into nooks and crannies.In an August press release,the company revealed that a 4.7 kg grab sample taken from gravity recoverable gold trapped behind a SAG mill liner graded 23,547 g t gold.Listening to SAG Mill Noise Pays Off for Pueblo Viejo E &amp; MJOne of these initiatives was to install an acoustic monitoring system on the SAG mill.After SmartEar was installed in January 2013,data from the system was used to optimize the mill’s performance by minimizing any interval in which the mill is either running too quietly or too loudly.
