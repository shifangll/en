## How to Calculate the Water to Cement Ratio The Concrete,
The water to cement ratio is calculated by dividing the water in one cubic yard of the mix ( in pounds) by the cement in the mix (in pounds) So if one cubic yard of the mix has 235 pounds of water and 470 pounds of cement the mix is a 50 water to cement ratio2a Concrete Mix Design VTCNormal Concrete Mix Design 1.Prescribed Mix.To design a concrete mix with characteristic strength of 30 MPa,what should the target mean strength be?
