## Fly Ash Bricks Information
&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;Fly Ash Bricks What is Fly ash? How fly ash is produced? How fly ash is dangerous? If we use fly ash in brick then is it harmful for human health? Is fly ash brick weaker than red clay brick? How.How concrete is madeFly ash,a coal burning power plant byproduct that contains an aluminosilicate and small amounts of lime,is also being tested as a possible pozzolanic material for cement.Combining fly ash with lime (CaO) in a hydrothermal process (one that uses hot water under pressure) also produces cement.
