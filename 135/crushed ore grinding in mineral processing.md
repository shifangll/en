## Crushing in Mineral Processing
2&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;In mineral processing or metallurgy,the first stage of comminution is crushing.Depending of the type of rock (geometallurgy) to be crushed,there are 2 largely different techniques at your disposition for crushing rocks.In principle,compression crushing is used on hard and abrasive rocks by placing them between a high wear resistant plate surface.Less abrasive and softer rocks or stones.Mineral processing metallurgy Britannica5&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Mineral processing,art of treating crude ores and mineral products in order to separate the valuable minerals from the waste rock,or gangue.It is the first process that most ores undergo after mining in order to provide a more concentrated material for the procedures of extractive metallurgy.

## Sino Grinding Mineral Processing
31&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Mineral processing typically involves the crushing and grinding of hard rock ore.Crushed ore is introduced to semi autogenous grinding (SAG) mills,also known as primary mills,where grinding media is released like hammers to assist in the ore cracking grinding process.What is Mineral Processing? (with pictures)7&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Modern mineral processing techniques typically use mechanized unit processes to separate minerals from ore.The first process is typically comminution,which can consist of crushing or grinding an ore.This procedure can break minerals out of the ores,allowing them to be further processed.
