## Iron ore (fines)
Because of this comminution,tailings consist of a slurry of fine particles,ranging from the size of a grain of sand to a few micrometres.[1] Mine tailings are usually produced from the mill in slurry form,which is a mixture of fine mineral particles and water.Australia’s Iron Ore Product QualityAustralia’s iron ore production has seen strong growth over the past five decades and over this period of time a very significant change in the blend of Australian iron ore production has occurred.Initially there was a clear preference for the mining of Premium
