## Autogenous and Semi Autogenous Mills
9.1.Introduction Disintegration and size reduction of some ores is possible in tumbling mills without the aid of grinding media.Grinding mills in which comminution takes place without grinding aids are known as autogenous grinding (AG) mills or fully autogenous grinding (FAG) mills.(FAG) mills.Autogenous Grinding InformationPhoto of Autogenous Mill at a copper mine.Autogenous Mills operate,mechanically,similar to the ball mill.They differ in the media they use to break or grind the ore.Autogenous Mills use large particles of ore instead of steel or other balls for grinding media.
