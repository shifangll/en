For most small scale gold prospectors,crushing ore to determine the amount of free gold is the best method to determine gold content within an ore sample.Free gold can then be collected using traditional gravity based methods,which do not require the same level of permitting as the chemical methods used by commercial gold mines.&#187; The Basics of Successful Gold Mining Part 1Successful gold mining is generally done in two steps: First is sampling or prospecting,and then,production.While some gold bearing creeks and rivers tend to have gold values dispersed throughout their entire streambeds,there is generally not enough gold to make a small scale mining operation ‚Ä¶
