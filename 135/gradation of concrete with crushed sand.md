## How to Assess the Quality of Fine Aggregate at Site?
3.2.Based on Fineness Modulus As per IS 1542: 1992 clause 5.2,the fineness modulus of sand shall be not less than 1.4 in case of crushed stone sands and crushed gravel sand and not less than 1.5 in case of naturally occurring sands.Lower FM indicates fineAggregate in ConcreteFind Manufacturers: Admixtures Aggregates are generally thought of as inert filler within a concrete mix.But a closer look reveals the major role and influence aggregate plays in the properties of both fresh and hardened concrete.Changes in gradation,maximum.
