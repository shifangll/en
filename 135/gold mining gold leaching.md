## Gold mining in the United States
Gold mining in the United States has taken place continually since the discovery of gold at the Reed farm in North Carolina in 1799.The first documented occurrence of gold was in Virginia in 1782.[1] Some minor gold production took place in North Carolina as early as 1793,but created no excitement.The discovery on the Reed farm in 1799.Gold Extraction Mining Gold.infoEven though the precious metal gold only occurs very rarely indeed,it can be found almost everywhere on the planet in the 16 kilometre thick Earth’s crust.But the amount of gold in the earth is extremely small,so that mining is not really worthwhile.Generally there.
