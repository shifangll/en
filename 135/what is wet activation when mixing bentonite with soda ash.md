A bentonite binder composition and method of preparation is disclosed.The binder composition is particularly useful for pelletizing iron ore fines.It is prepared by intimately combining and mixing wet bentonite in a stockpile with soda ash,the moisture in the wet.Bentonite Properties are UniqueSoda ash can often be purchased in the detergent section of stores as washing soda,sal soda,or natron.(Sodium bicarbonate,called baking soda,is not the same thing).Soda ash dissolved in water before adding bentonite will improve the bentonite properties by adjusting the pH and the ''hardness'' of the water to the ideal range for hydrating the bentonite.
