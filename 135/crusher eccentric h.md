## Gyratory Crushers
Essentially,the gyratory crusher consists of a heavy cast iron,or steel,frame which includes in its lower part an actuating mechanism (eccentric and driving gears),and in its upper part a cone shaped crushing chamber,lined with wear resisting plates (concaves).Spanning the crushing chamber across its top is a steady rest (spider),containing a machined journalCrusherA crusher is a machine designed to reduce large rocks into smaller rocks,gravel,or rock dust.Crushers may be used to reduce the size,or change the form,of waste materials so they can be more easily disposed of or recycled,or to reduce the size of a solid mix of raw materials (as in rock ore),so that pieces of different composition can be differentiated.
