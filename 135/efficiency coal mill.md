## Turbine Efficiency
S.C.Bhatia,in Advanced Renewable Energy Systems,2014.Gas turbine efficiency.Turbine efficiency is the ratio of actual work output of the turbine to the net input energy supplied in the form of fuel.For stand alone gas turbines,without any heat recovery system the efficiency will be as low as 35 to 40 per cent.This is attributed to the blade efficiency oWind turbineEfficiency.Conservation of mass requires that the amount of air entering and exiting a turbine must be equal.Accordingly,Betz's law gives the maximal achievable extraction of wind power by a wind turbine as 16 27 (59.3%) of the total kinetic energy of the air flowing through the turbine.

efficiency for a geothermal turbine would typically range between 81 and 85% [26].The turbine efficiency drops due to deviation from isentropic behaviour and the presence of moisture in the turbine during the steam expansion process.The Baumann rule shows that the presence of 1% average moisture causes a drop of about 1% turbine efficiency.
