## COPPER Copper production
Copper production About 80 % of primary copper production comes from low grade or poor sulfide ores.After enrichment steps,the copper concentrates are usually treated by pyrometallurgical methods.Generally,copper extraction follows the sequence (seeCopper Mining and Processing: Processing of Copper Ores …Copper processing is a complicated process that begins with mining of the ore (less than 1% copper) and ends with sheets of 99.99% pure copper called cathodes,which will ultimately be made into products for everyday use.The most common types of ore,copper oxide and copper sulfide,undergo two different processes,hydrometallurgy and pyrometallurgy,respectively,due to the different.
