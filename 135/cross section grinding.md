## Modeling and Predicting Surface Roughness for the …
This paper proposes a new algorithm for predicting the cross sectional surface roughness of the workpiece for the grinding process,which reduces three dimensional modeling to two dimensional modeling by virtue of the cross sectional area of the undeformed.
