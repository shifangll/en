## Iron Ore Magnetic Separation
 · The trapped magnetic particles are easily washed out when the applied field is reduced to zero.Magnetic separators of this type are useful for the concentration or removal of fine magnetic particles when processing of iron ore for pellet feed.Magnetic separators are integral part of the low grade iron ore beneficiation systems.Mineral processing WikipediaThe first pair of electromagnets was weakly magnetised and served to draw off any iron ore present.The second pair were strongly magnetised and attracted the wolframite,which is weakly magnetic.These machines were capable of treating 10 tons of ore a day.This process of separating magnetic substances from the non magnetic substances in a.
