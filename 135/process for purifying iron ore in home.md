## How is Iron Refined from Ore? (with pictures)
&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;Although iron does not occur in its pure form in nature,some kinds of ore contain up to 70% iron atoms.Iron ore consists of oxygen and iron atoms bonded together into molecules.To create pure iron,one must deoxygenate the ore,leaving only iron atoms behind,which is the essence of the refining process.Processing,smelting and refining gold World Gold CouncilFrom ore to dor&#233; Cyanidation More gold is recovered by cyanidation than by any other process.In cyanidation,metallic gold is oxidised and dissolved in an alkaline cyanide solution.When gold dissolution is complete,the gold bearing solution is separated from the

If not removed from the ore this mercury is likely to under volatilization during the smelting process and can cause serious health and environmental problems.*Iron removal Iron in the gold ore can be oxidized with the Nitre and this can corrode your smelting pot increasing the smelting cost and in other cases may cause leaks which can be catastrophic and result in huge losses.The Extraction of IronSaving of raw materials and energy by not having to first extract the iron from the ore.Avoiding the pollution problems in the extraction of iron from the ore.Not having to find space to dump the unwanted iron if it wasn't recycled.
