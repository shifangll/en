1.Introduction to the extraction of metals What methods can be used in extracting metals from mineral ores? Why can one method be used to extract one metal,but not another? The Earth's crust contains many different rocks.Rocks are a mixture of minerals and from some we can make useful substances.How iron is madeIron ore is converted into various types of iron through several processes.The most common process is the use of a blast furnace to produce pig iron which is about 94% iron and 5% carbon with smaller amounts of other elements.

## How steel is made
To make steel,iron ore is first mined from the ground.It is then smelted in blast furnaces where the impurities are removed and carbon is added.In fact,a very simple definition of steel is &quot;iron alloyed with carbon,usually less than 1%.&quot; The following text is takenLeadLead is extracted from its ore by reduction with carbon.Considerable effort has to be made to separate the lead ore from zinc ores.In recent years,lead has become one of most highly recycled materials in general use.Uses of lead Over 80% of all lead produced.
