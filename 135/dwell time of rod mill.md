## Stroker Motors Basics and Theory
Piston Dwell Time and Piston Speed An often overlooked factor that contributes to the advantage of a stroker motor has to do with piston dwell time,the amount of time the piston remains at the top and bottom of the stroke.The increased stroke and rod length of a stroker motor yields a longer piston dwell time.Dwell time and short stroke Piston speed&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;Dwell time and short stroke Piston speed.Post by robAP &#187; Wed Apr 06,2005 12:38 pm.The length of the stroke does not affect the dwell time.The rod's length in relation to the stroke does.The shorter rod will have less 'dwell' time at tdc,but the long rod will have greater acceler

## Re: 407 Rods
A longer connecting rod for a given stroke allows the piston to dwell longer at TDC before it starts back down on the power stroke.This allows pressure to build longer in the combustion chamber before it starts to shove the piston down.The result is usually a broader,fla
