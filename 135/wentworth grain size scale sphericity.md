## Sedimentary rock
This millimetre,or Udden Wentworth,scale is a geometric grain size scale since there is a constant ratio between class limits.Such a scheme is well suited for the description of sediments because it gives equal significance to size ratios,whether they relate to gravel,sand,silt,or clay.The phi scale is a useful,logarithmic based.Detrital Sedimentary Rocks UNIT 2 Clastic Sediments …Gravel and Conglomerate : Size greater than 2mm Sand and Sandstone: 2mm to 1 16 mm Mud and Mudstone: Less than 1 16 mm The Udden Wentworth grain size scale Known as the Wentworth scale,this is the most widely accepted sediments.scale for classifying clastic The divisions on the scale are made on the basis of factors of 2.
