## Effects of mill feed size and rod charges on grinding …
The effect of reducing mill feed size on product fineness decreases with grinding time,while the effects of different composition of rod charges are very small.Smaller rod diameter,coarser mill feed size and shorter grinding time will increase the energy utilizationTo increase torque in an engine you'd. AnandTech …&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;Increasing the rod length will not increase the stroke.It will simply move the piston farther away from the crankshaft.Furthermore,although installing longer rods is popular in the hot rodding world,the actual gains are minimal to none.If you choose to increase.
