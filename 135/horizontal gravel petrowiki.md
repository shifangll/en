## Types of completions
14&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Open hole completions were originally used in the early days of the petroleum industry when most wells were drilled with cable tools.Normally,casing was run as the hole was drilled.When the formation was penetrated and oil and gas began to flow,drilling ceased and the well was produced as an open hole completion.Well completion18&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Although not common in most areas,open hole completions are still used today in certain situations,such as the horizontal well completions in the Austin Chalk and in the Devonian shales in Appalachia.In a typical open hole completion,casing is set prior to drilling into the producing interval.

## Sand control techniques
The gravel is sized to be about 5 to 6 times larger than the median formation sand size.Gravel packing creates a permeable downhole filter that allows the production of the formation fluids but restricts the entry and production of formation sand.Schematics of an openhole and cased hole gravel pack are shown in Fig.1.If the gravel is.PetroWiki Flashcards QuizletIn the context of logging,this is a horizontal plane; it is the angle (measured clockwise) of well path departure usually from magnetic north.It may also be expressed as the compass direction of the path of the well bore as measured by a borehole survey.(Note: check the specifics of the survey for the details).

## Perforating design
The perforating design needed for a cased and cemented highly deviated (greater than approximately 60&#176;) well may be different from the design needed for a vertical well,even in a similar formation.The main factors are: Placement of guns; Cost of perforating in very long sections; Need to produce selectively from a certain section of the wellboreThe Guide to Oilwell Fishing Operations ScienceDirectUntil the early 1990s,few pipe cutting operations were performed using coiled tubing as a means of conveyance.A drilling or workover rig with a jointed pipe workstring was the primary choice for conveying mechanical and hydraulic pipe cutting tools when wireline methods were not suitable—particularly in highly deviated and horizontal wells.
