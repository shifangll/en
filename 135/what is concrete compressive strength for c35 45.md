Answer shyam sundar in few instances we mark C35 20.in indicate C35,is concrete grade or strenght (both same) as 35Mpa in 28 days.20 is the agreegate size.Answer bilal EC2 classifies the compressive strength of normal concrete in relation to cylindricalCompressive strength prediction of Portland cement,Compressive strength prediction of Portland cement concrete with age using a new model,Concrete compressive strength is influenced by many factors including,water cement ratio,cement content and properties,aggregate type and its properties,etc,457  569 654: M5.
