## Density of Aggregate
Density is an important parameter for aggregate.For aggregates,density is determined by multiplying the relative density (specific gravity) of the aggregate times the density of water.Bulk Density of Aggregate [1]The bulk density or unit weight of an aggregate is the mass or weight of the aggregate that required to fill a container of a specified unit volume.weight of one cubic metre of 14mm stone financequizinAggregate Calculator gravel stone chippings path driveway Un compacted Cloburn aggregates weigh 14 tonnes per cubic metre Therefore if you wish to apply them at,

## What is Unit weight of 20 mm aggregate? scienceanswers
unit wight of 20mm aggregate To find the weight of the rod,take its volume ( pi * radius 2 * length for a cylindrical rod,make sure height and radius are the same unit) and multiply by the substance's,density In this case,assuming the diameter is 20 mm,314 * 10 2 (the radius) * 1000 (1 meter = 1,000 mm) = 314,000 cubic centimetersAggregate mbpolBoth coarse aggregates (particle sizes of 20 mm to 4 mm) and fine aggregates (particle sizes less than 4 mm) are required but the proportions of different sizes of coarse aggregate will vary depending on the particular mix required for each individual end use
