Shrink Fit Tool Holders The shrink fit holder is one of the more popular styles of tool holders because of its ability to be more customizable,as evident in the chart above.In this method,a collet is heated to expand,then cooled to contract around the shank of a tool.Shrink Fit Tool Holders &amp; AdaptersShrink Fit toolholders use heat to expand the bore that holds the tool shank,when it cools the contracting metal grips the cutting tool with uniform pressure.This provides the best concentricity,balance and rigidity for high speed machining.
