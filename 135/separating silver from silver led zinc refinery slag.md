Exposure to a wide variety of hazardous dusts,fumes,gases and other chemicals can occur during smelting and refining operations,Antimony,tin and arsenic are removed first Then zinc is added and gold and silver are removed in the zinc slag Next,the lead is refined by vacuum removal (distillation) of zinc,lead and other metals.CA2798302A1 Process for recovering valuable metals from,Through utilizing a top blown rotary furnace as the smelting apparatus and adjusting the ratio of the flux,the present invention enriches the valuable metals gold,silver,bismuth,lead or the like to lead bismuth alloy,ensures lower contents of gold,silver,bismuth and lead in the reducing slag and thereby increases the comprehensive.

## Could you separate gold if it was mixed melted with other,
Sure It’s called refining Some people use acids to dissolve all the metals into a solution and then precipitate out just the gold out of solution Nasty chemicals Some people use electricity and chemicals Same result Just less nasty Good ref.
