Tungsten mines are relatively small and rarely produce more than 2000t of ore per day.Mining methods for tungsten ore are not at all exceptional and usually are adapted to the geology of the ore deposit.Most tungsten ores contain less than 1.5% WO 3 and frequently only a few tenths of a percent.Extraction of tungsten from simulated autoclave soda.Aiming at this problem,the direct extraction of tungsten from simulated autoclave soda leaching liquor was researched in order to shorten the flowsheet and cancel the regeneration process by.

## How is tungsten extracted from its ore?
Question posed is ‘How is tungsten extracted from its ore?’ Tungsten is generally found in scheelite,wolframite,or ferberite.Extracting the tungsten means also separating the tungsten from other metallic cations in the ore.This is a multi step.TUNGSTEN19&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;that optimises extraction rather than cost (eg.cut &amp; fill or sublevel stoping with cemented fill and secondary pillar recovery).If ore values are low,mass mining methods allow production at low unit value,but these methods incur high loss and or dilution.2.Figure 5: Maoping Tungsten &amp; Molybenum Mine,Jiangxi Province,China.
