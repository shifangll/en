## How to Reduce Steel Consumption in Grinding Mills
This study on the wear of steel in the grinding mills has lead to the following general conclusions: The loss of steel due to wear in grinding mills represents a large portion of the operating cost.It is expected that the steel wear loss will continue to increase.Number of Mills in a Grinding CircuitsBall mills and some stirred mills,such as the screw agitated mill and the pin agitated mill,can operate at reduced ball levels and,therefore,power draws.These changes in ball charge can be used to minimize overgrinding during known periods of reduced throughput,such as startup periods,but typically cannot follow the normal capacity swings resulting from short term changes in the feed rate.
