## Crushers
Gyratory crushers have an oscillating shaft.The material is reduced in a crushing cavity,between an external fixed element (bowl liner) and an internal moving element (mantle) mounted on the oscillating shaft assembly.The fragmentation of the material results from the continuous compression that takes place between the liners around the chamber.Pebble crushing sand Making machine ATAIRAC.In the whole process of crushing,the materials are smashed with each other,not directly contacting with the metal elements,but with the material lining of the impact,rub and crush,which reduces the angle of pollution,prolong the mechanical wear time.
