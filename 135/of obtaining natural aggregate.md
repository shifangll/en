## A Solid Base Is Rock Steady
Some regions have inadequate sources of aggregate,as local quarry resources may be too scarce or of insufficient quality for pavement construction.If the cost of obtaining natural aggregate is prohibitive,it may be possible to substitute suitable manufacturedOf Obtaining Stones Aggregateaggregate is obtaining a good sample of the material to be tested.Knowing how to get a good representative sample from a crushing operation,a stockpile,a windrow,or a paving operation is absolutely critical to getting good test results from a lab.Poor sampling
