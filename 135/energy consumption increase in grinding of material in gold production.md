## Factors Influence Ore Grinding Mill Efficiency
The liner plays the role of protecting the cylinder and end cover of the mill and lifting the grinding medium.The shape and material of liner have a great influence on the steel consumption of grinding.In addition to the traditional manganese steel liner,there arePopulation and Consumption,Consumption patternsChanges in patterns of consumption may have an even greater effect than population increase.As populous countries such as China and India become more industrialised they will consume more energy and other resources.

## Mill (grinding)
A mill is a device that breaks solid materials into smaller pieces by grinding,crushing,or cutting.Such comminution is an important unit operation in many processes.There are many different types of mills and many types of materials processed in them.Historically mills were powered by hand (e.g.via a hand crank),working animal (e.g.Power Consumption Per Ton Grinding Cementpower consumption per ton grinding cement Enhanced grinding properties of the cement mill due to less accumulation of material on grinding balls and millliners higher separator efficiency due to improved cement particle dispersion reduced relative power.

## Quantifying Grinding Efficiency
Grinding efficiency could be defined in many ways,useful consumption of energy usually being the parameter to be maximized.The Bond Work Index is a measure of theoretical power consumption to grind to a certain size while the Operating Work Index can be measured for an industrial system and reductions in Operating Work Index show improvements in efficiency.
