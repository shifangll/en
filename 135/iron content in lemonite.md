## Limonite
There are three main types of iron ore—hematite,magnetite,and limonite —of which hematite is the most important because of its high iron content.The iron content is around 60%.Thus,the preparation process adopted is very simple.ERICLimonite is the field term for a mixed assemblage of ferric oxyhydroxides,often containing nonferric silicate impurities.It is abundant on Earth's surface,possesses variable iron content,and is easily recognized by distinctive yellow and ochre hues.Limonite is a.
