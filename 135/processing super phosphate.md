## Applications and functions of food‐grade phosphates.
Introduction.Phosphate rock is mined all over the world with the largest reserves of high purity originating in Morocco.1 The mined and crushed rock is reacted with sulfuric acid followed by a solvent extraction of the phosphoric acid and release into an aqueous phase.The acid is dearsenified and deflourinated,resulting in food‐grade phosphoric acid (purified wet acid or PWA).Phosphorus Fertilizer Production and Technology29&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Ore grade in the phosphate mining industry is one of the primary criterion used to differentiate phosphate ores.Grade is oft\൥n expressed in terms of bone phosphate of lime \⠀䈀䰀 or phosphorus pentoxide \⠀㈀㔀.The use of BPL is from the outdated belief that P in PR existed as tricalcium phosphate.
