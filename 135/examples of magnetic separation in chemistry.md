## Magnetic Separation Method
2&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Magnetic separation is a process used to separate materials from those that are less or non&#173;magnetic.All materials have a response when placed in a magnetic field,although with most,the effect is too slight to be detected.The few materials that are strongly affected (magnetised) by magnetic fields are known as “Ferromagnetics”,those lesser (though noticeably) affected are known as.Chromatography Definition and ExamplesChromatography is a group of laboratory techniques used to separate the components of a mixture by passing the mixture through a stationary phase.Typically,the sample is suspended in the liquid or gas phase and is separated or identified based on how it flows through or around a liquid or solid phase.

## What Is Magnetism? Definition,Examples,Facts
When electrons pairs are present,their &quot;spin&quot; magnetic moments cancel each other out.In a magnetic field,diamagnetic materials are weakly magnetized in the opposite direction of the applied field.Examples of diamagnetic materials include gold,quartz,water,copper,and air.Magnetic Separation by Jack Shenfield on PreziOpposite Charges (Negative and Positive) are attracted to each other.So two souths or two negatives don't attract,and the same with two norths and two positives.By Jack Shenfield Magnetic Separation is the use of separating mixtures with a magnet.What is Magnetic Separation?
