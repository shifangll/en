## Beneficiation of Iron Ore
This iron can also be used in steel production or purified further to give wrought iron.Waste gas mixture that exudes from the furnace contains majorly nitrogen,30% carbon(II)oxide and about 10% carbon(IV)oxide.These waste gas mixture is used in pre heating the air blast and the iron ore at the initial stages of the extraction process.Metal Profile: Iron Properties and CharacteristicsIron was likely originally discovered and extracted as a result of wood burning on top of iron containing ores.﻿ ﻿ The carbon within the wood would have reacted with the oxygen in the ore,leaving behind a soft,malleable iron metal.Iron smelting and the use of iron to make tools and weapons began in Mesopotamia (present day Iraq) between 27 BCE.
