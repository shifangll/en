## HOW BALL MILL WORKS?
&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;The drum of the ball mill (Pic.1) is a hollow cylinder of steel,lined inside with armor lining plates which protect it from impact and friction effects of the balls and the grinding material.The shape of drum liners has a significant impact on mill’s work.Drum Liners of ball mills operated on a large source material have ribs.Mill (grinding)Ball mill A typical type of fine grinder is the ball mill.A slightly inclined or horizontal rotating cylinder is partially filled with balls,usually stone or metal,which grind material to the necessary fineness by friction and impact with the tumbling balls.Ball mills normally.

## Bond Work Index Formula Equation
See this useful summary Table of Bond Work Index by Minerals.For any circuit,whether a crushing circuit,a rod mill,or a closed ball mill circuit,the Work Index always means the equivalent amount of energy to reduce one ton of the ore from a very large size to 100 um.Ball MillWork Index Ball Mill,alluding to the grind ability list of Metals,is utilized to demonstrate the granulating trouble of the material.It is measured by a rule that to compute the work file ball plant in light of yield of every unrest of the factory after the material is ground to an adjusted state by the predetermined plan.
