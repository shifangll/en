## Key factors in determining investment in mining
Types of costs in the mining sector All the costs faced by companies can be broken into two main categories: fixed costs and variable costs.Fixed costs: Mining like any other business must incur costs that do not vary with the level of output.These are expenses that have to be paid by a company,independent of any mining.Copper Production Cost Details Released by ChileThis was lower than the average cost of copper production in 2Q14,which was $1.655 per pound of copper produced.The above graph gives details of copper production costs of Chile from 2005 till 2014.

Copper minerals and ores are found in both igneous and sedimentary rocks.Mining of copper ores is carried out using one of two methods.However,by far the greatest extension in the use of copper resulted from Michael Faraday's discovery of electromagnetic induction in 1831 and the way that the effect could be used to generate electricity.Minding the gaps in the copper cost curve: Andy Home&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;The most obvious part of this process is the falling cost of energy inputs to the mining and processing cost matrix.Then there is the.Goldman forecasts marginal copper production costs.
