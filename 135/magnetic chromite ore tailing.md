## Magnetic separation
Magnetic separation is the process of separating components of mixtures by using magnets to attract magnetic materials.[1] The process that is used for magnetic separation detaches non magnetic material with those who are magnetic.This technique is useful for not all,but few minerals such as ferromagnetic (materials strongly affected by.New aspect of chromite gravity tailings re processing …However,chromite ore from Sukinda region,India is a typical ore body with high iron content in the chromite spinel as well as gangue content in the form of oxide and hydroxides of iron bearing.
