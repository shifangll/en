## How MAGLEV Trains Work? electronics
Maglev trains have no contacts with the rails while they move forward.They are levitated on the guide way with the help of magnetic forces.Levitation is the process by which an object is suspended against gravity in a stable position without any physical contact.Maglev Train 百度文库2013 10 20&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Maglev Train 磁悬浮列车 Q: What does maglev mean? A: Maglev is short for magnetic levitation(漂浮）,which means that these trains will float over a guide way(导轨） using the basic principles of magnets to replace the old steel wheel and track trains.
