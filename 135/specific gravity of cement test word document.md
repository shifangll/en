AnswersDriveThe term “Specific Gravity” (SG) is used to define the weight or density of a liquid as compared to the density of an equal volume of water at a specified temperature.The temperature used for measurement is usually 39.2 o F (4 o C),because this temperature allows water to assume its maximum density.

## Experiment 1 Specific gravity for Coarse and fine,
Introduction: Specific gravity and water abortion test is one of the important tests on which the study of building materials based on The specific gravity of an aggregate is considered to be a measure of strength or quality of the material Aggregates having low specific gravity are generally weaker than those with higher specific gravity valu499 Concrete General29&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Specific Gravity.Specific gravity values of aggregates are used to calculate aggregate weights used in concrete mix design.Where the actual specific gravity of an aggregate varies by more than &#177;0.02 from those listed in 499.03,the mix design weights shown in the tables must be adjusted.This section shows how to make those adjustments.
