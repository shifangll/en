## Ball Mills
Ball mills are rated by power rather than capacity.Today,the largest ball mill in operation is 8.53 m diameter and 13.41 m long with a corresponding motor power of 22 MW (Toromocho,private communications).The costs of installationOptimization of mill performance by usingMill power Usually,plant operators use mill power readings as an indicator of ball filling degree and,often,try to keep it at the maximum level.It is well known that the mill absorbed power depends on operating parameters other than ball level,such as pulp density and liner configuration.Figure 2 shows that there is no linear relation between
