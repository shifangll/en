What is Extractive Metallurgy ? Deals with extraction of metals from its naturally existing ore minerals and refining them Minerals: Inorganic compounds with more than one metal in association with non metals like S,O,N etc Naturally existing minerals are sulphides,oxides,halides like: Hematite (Fe2O3),Magnetite (Fe3O4),Chalcopyrite (CuFeS2),DolomiteMineral Processingmainly to techniques for dressing raw materials obtained from mines.Such techniques are now classified as me chanical processing in contrast to metallurgical tech niques where the value minerals are chemically altered,such as in the reduction of iron ore (iron.
