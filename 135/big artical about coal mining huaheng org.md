Coal is classified into four main types,or ranks,based on carbon and heat content.The general rule is that the higher the grade of coal,the cleaner it burns and the more versatile its uses.Lignite (25% % carbon): Also referred to as brown coal,is the lowest rank of coal and used almost exclusively as fuel for electricity power generation.Coal Power Impacts Union of Concerned ScientistsCoal impacts: water pollution When you burn charcoal in your grill at home,ash is leftover.The same is true for coal fired power plants,which produce more than 100 million tons of coal ash every year.More than half of that waste ends up in ponds,lakes,landfills,and other sites where,over time,it can contaminate waterways and drinking water supplies.
