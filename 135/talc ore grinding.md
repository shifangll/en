Beneficiation of talc from most ores involves grinding,flotation and magnetic separation of the iron oxide minerals.Flotation is the preferred concentration technique because talc is naturally floatable,requiring only a frother to affect flotation [3 71.In the current study,a representative sample of Egyptian talc carbonate ore&nbsp;.Sustainability EurotalcMining activities,ore processing (crushing,grinding,flotation) and product storage,bagging and shipping inevitably generate emissions in the form of dust,noise and waste water—although the latter is very limited as talc processing is mostly carried&nbsp;.
