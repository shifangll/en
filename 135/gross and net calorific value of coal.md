## gross calorific value中文 gross calorific value是什么意思
Coal and coke determination of gross calorific value by the bomb calorimetric method,and calculation of net calorific value 煤和焦炭用量热弹法和净发热值的计算法测定总发热值; Animal feeding stuffs,animal products,and faeces or urine determination of gross calorific value bomb calorimeter methodGross Calorific ValueSolid biomass fuels are more costly than coal,oil,and natural gas,even when compared on a simple gross calorific value (GCV) or net calorific value (NCV) basis.The cost disadvantage of solid biofuels is accentuated by the lower comparative efficiency of use in power generation,in synthesis gas production,and in direct heating systems.
