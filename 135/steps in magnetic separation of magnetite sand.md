&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;Magnetic separation is a process in which magnetically susceptible material is extracted from a mixture using a magnetic force.This separation technique can be useful in mining iron as it is.IronsandIronsand,also known as iron sand or iron sand,is a type of sand with heavy concentrations of iron.It is typically dark grey or blackish in colour.It is composed mainly of magnetite,Fe 3 O 4,and also contains small amounts of titanium,silica,manganese,calcium and vanadium.

Magnetic Separation in Sand Processing Magnetic Separation Techniques Normally silica sand producers prefer to process material in the wet state to obviate the need for costly drying although some producers process after any drying stage to achieve maximum benefit Wet Separation Until recently the only wet high intensity magnetic separation or WHIMS available was based onPreparation of size controlled nanoparticles of magnetite …Highlights From report protocols,chemical synthesis of magnetite with FeCl 3 (stable in air) instead of FeCl 2 or Fe(NO 3) 3,precursor.Chemical reduction with Na 2 SO 3 provides an additional advantage.As any eventual reformation of Fe 3+ from reoxidization of produced Fe 2+ may be sequestered by remaining SO 3 2 − in the medium.Nanoparticles are stably individualized with.

## Processing of Magnetite Iron Ores
Historically,the lowest operating cost was achieved by multistage fully autogenous grinding with integrated magnetic separation steps between the stages.The major benefit of fully autogenous grinding is the elimination of steel grinding media costs and the need to discriminate between steel and magnetite in coarse magnetic separation.Magnetite Sand Separation Process Heavy MachineryMagnetite Sand Separation Process We have Magnetite Sand Separation Process,Commercial magnetic units follow a continuous separation process on a moving stream of dry or wet particles passing through a low or high magnetic field the various magnetic separators are drum crossbelt roll highgradient magnetic separation highintensity magnetic separation and low
