Heavy mineral sands are a class of ore deposit which is an important source of zirconium,titanium,thorium,tungsten,rare earth elements,the industrial minerals diamond,sapphire,garnet,and occasionally precious metals or gemstones.Heavy mineral sands are placer deposits formed most usually in beach environments by concentration due to the specific gravity of the mineral grains.A Comparison of the Methods of Heavy Mineral Separation,A Comparison of the Methods of Heavy Mineral Separation Volume 68 Issue 3 C J C Ewing Skip to main content Accessibility help We use cookies to distinguish you from other users and to provide you with a better experience on our websit

## Mineral processing
Gravity separation is one of the oldest technique in mineral processing but has seen a decline in its use since the introduction of methods like flotation,classification,magnetic separation and leaching.Gravity separation dates back to at least 3000 BC whenHeavy media separation BritannicaIn heavy media separation (also called sink and float separation),the medium used is a suspension in water of a finely ground heavy mineral (such as magnetite or arsenopyrite) or technical product (such as ferrosilicon) Such a suspension can simulate a fluid with a higher density than water When.
