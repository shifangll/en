The magnetic aggregates so produced are subsequently separated using high intensity separation.The halite and the sylvite do not flocculate and remain non magnetic.After magnetic removal of the insoluble slimes the non magnetic product can be returned to the circuit for fractionation of the sylvite and halite …Magnetic separation process for trona6&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;The magnetic separation step is accomplished by a rare earth magnetic separation method.With regard to the beneficiation of trona,typical impurities can be removed during the magnetic separation step include shale,which has a higher magnetic susceptibility than trona.

## primary iron magnetic separator recovery processing
Magnetic separation is an old technique for the concentration of iron ores and for the removal of tramp iron.Since 1849,a number of patents on magnetic separation have been issued in USA,and texts of some of the patents before 1910 describe a variety of magnetic separators for mineral processing.Halite salt: The mineral Halite information and picturesHalite,the natural form of salt,is a very common and well known mineral.It is found in solid masses,and as a dissolved solution in the oceans and in salt lakes.The inland lakes that are rich in salt exist in arid regions,and may also be below sea level without an outlet.These lakes evaporate during dry seasons,causing a recession in the water level and an increase of salinity content.
