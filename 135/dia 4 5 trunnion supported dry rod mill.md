## Rod mills,how they function
The rods grind the ore by tumbling within the the mill,similar to the grinding balls in a ball mill.To prevent the conditions leading to rod charge tangling,the length to diameter ratio is maintained at 1.4 to 1.6.Rod mills accept feed up to about 50 mm (2 in.) and produce a product in the size range of 3000 to 270 mm ( 4 to 35 mesh).Rod Mills for coarse grinding FLSmidthDesigns extend to 15 feet x 22 feet (21 feet effective).Though mill length is limited by manufacturing constraints for the grinding rods,our Rod Mills are available in diameters from 5 feet up to 15 feet.Designs extend t

## Trunnion
A trunnion (from Old French &quot;trognon&quot;,trunk) is a cylindrical protrusion used as a mounting or pivoting point.First associated with cannons,they are an important military development.Alternatively,a trunnion is a shaft that positions and supports a tilting plate.This is a misnomer,as in reality it is a cradle for the true trunnion.K20 Center Homenbsp 0183 32 4 Theorbo 5 Bouzouki 6 Guitar 1 Point Zero 2 The Legacy of Joseph and Sheila Murumbi 3 African Jewellery 4 African Royalty and Textiles 5 African Artefacts Gallery 6 Corridor to Art History and Coffee 7 A Cultural Place Instruments that
