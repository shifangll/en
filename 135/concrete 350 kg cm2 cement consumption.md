## cement consumption per square feet in multi storeyed …
Cement consumption for building is 0.5 per sq.ft.and for multistoryed building it Will be 0.65 per sq.ft Is This Answer Correct ? 2 Yes.cement consumption per square feet in multi storeyed building.Answer sjtbehera i Know per cum it is about 350 kg.How many bags of cement do I need to make a concrete …By simple formula you need to calculate the volume of concrete assume it is 20 m3.assume the concrete grade is 25 MPa equal to 250 kg cm2 so the cement as a rule of thumb= 250+100=350 kg cement m3 (concrete)= 350 50(bag weight)=7 bags so the tota.
