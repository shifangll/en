## Gyratory Crusher
A gyratory crusher is an ore processing machine that crushes the ore between an eccentrically mounted cone and a crushing throat that is fixed.In mining,the most important criteria for effective crushing of oresis to choose the type of crusher that suits the rock (ore) material and to ensure uniform feed.Primary CrusherThe gyratory crusher has capacities starting from 1200 to above 5000 t h.To have a feed opening corresponding to that of a jaw crusher,the primary gyratory crusher must be much taller and heavier.Therefore,primary gyratories require quite a massive foundation.
