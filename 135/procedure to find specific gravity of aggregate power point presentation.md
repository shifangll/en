## Metal casting processes
29&ensp;&#0183;&ensp; The mould is made by packing some readily formed aggregate material,such as moulding sand,surrounding the pattern.When the pattern is withdrawn,its imprint provides the mould cavity.This cavity is filled with metal to become the casting. If the casting is to be hollow,additional patterns called ‘cores’,are used to form these cavities.Filtration5&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Filtration 1 Filtration.Filtration plays an important role in the natural treatment of groundwater as it percolates through the soil.It is also a major part of most water treatment.Groundwater that has been softened,or treated through iron and manganese oxidation,remove floc created by quires filtration to re coagulation or oxidation.
