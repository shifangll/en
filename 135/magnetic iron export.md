## Magnet
A magnet is a material or object that produces a magnetic field.This magnetic field is invisible but is responsible for the most notable property of a magnet: a force that pulls on other ferromagnetic materials,such as iron,and attracts or repels other magnets.A permanent magnet is an object made from a material that is magnetized and creates its own persistent magnetic field.ELECTRO MAGNETIC OR PERMANENT MAGNET.

## Effect of magnetic iron oxide nanoparticles in surface water.
The existing water treatment process often uses chemicals,which is of high health and environmental concern.The present study focused on the efficiency of microemulsion prepared magnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (ME MIONs) and protein functionalized nanoparticles (MOCP+ME MIONs) in water treatment.Effect of surfactant for magnetic properties of iron oxide nanoparticlesFor different medical applications nanoparticles (NPs) with well defined magnetic properties have to be used.Coating ligand can change the magnetic moment on the surface of nanostructures and therefore the magnetic behavior of the system.Here we investigated magnetic NPs in a size of 13 nm conjugated with four&nbsp;.

## Magnetism
Magnetism is a class of physical phenomena that are mediated by magnetic fields.Electric currents and the magnetic moments of elementary particles give rise to a magnetic field,which acts on other currents and magnetic moments.Magnetism is one aspect of the combined phenomenon of electromagnetism.The most familiar effects occur in.FerromagnetismFerromagnetism is the basic mechanism by which certain materials (such as iron) form permanent magnets,or are attracted to magnets.In physics,several different types of magnetism are distinguished.Ferromagnetism (along with the similar effect ferrimagnetism) is the strongest type and is responsible for the common phenomenon of magnetism in.
