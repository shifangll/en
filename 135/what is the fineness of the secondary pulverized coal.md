## Application Brief
Coal byproducts include coal tar and ammonia gas.The primary goals in monitoring various areas with a coal‐fired facility is to maintain the fineness of the pulverized coal,reduce the potential for explosive puffs that occur from an improper air‐to‐fuel ratio,reduceStandard Test Method for Sampling and Fineness Test of Pulverized CoalDesignation: D 197 87 (Reapproved 2002) Standard Test Method for Sampling and Fineness Test of Pulverized Coal1 This standard is issued under the ﬁxed designation D 197; the number immediately following the designation indicates the year of original adoption.
