## Understanding CNC Torque vs Horsepower
You can notice your HP meter jump as the tool enters the cut multiple times.This entry is when the torque curve on your CNC machine is the most important.Older CNC machines where designed to quickly reach peak torque between 1200 3000 RPM and then drop off.Newer,high speed machining centers hold constant torque.We like Constant Torque101 What is Particle Size Distribution D50,D50 Particle.Particle Size Distribution D50 is also known as median diameter or medium value of particle size distribution,it is the value of the particle diameter at 50% in the cumulative distribution.Particle Size Distribution D50 is one of an important parameter characterizing particle size.

## Rod mills,how they function
The rods grind the ore by tumbling within the the mill,similar to the grinding balls in a ball mill.To prevent the conditions leading to rod charge tangling,the length to diameter ratio is maintained at 1.4 to 1.6.Rod mills accept feed up to about 50 mm (2 in.) and produce a product in the size rangHigh frequency vibrating screens WikipediaHigh frequency vibrating screens are the most.(e.g.recirculating network with ball mill).Table below presents relationship between inclined angle with.
