## Coal Fly Ash
Fly ash concrete using Class F fly ash has a slower setting time than normal concrete.As a result,finishing operations may have to be delayed,possibly by 1 to 2 hours,depending on the temperature.Also,fly ash concrete surfaces may tend to be more sticky than normal concrete during placement and finishing,although properly proportioned.Influence of Fly Ash,Bottom Ash,and Light Expanded …Invention of new methods in strengthening concrete is under work for decades.Developing countries like India use the extensive reinforced construction works materials such as fly ash and bottom ash and other ingredients in RCC construction.In the construction industry,major attention has been devoted to the use of fly ash and bottom ash as cement and fine aggregate replacements.In addition.
