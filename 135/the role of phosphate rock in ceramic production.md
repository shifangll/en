## Superphosphate
The other main limiting factor for mulberry production is availability of water.In the absence of crop coefficients for mulberry (Allen et al.1998),crop water requirements were estimated based on irrigation recommendations.Following the recommendations of Dandin et al.(2003) for furrow irrigation,we estimate approximately 16,000 m 3 ha of water as annual use.Phosphorus is a key component of the resource demands …The world’s primary source of P for food production—phosphate rock—is nonrenewable,concentrated in only a few countries,and becoming increasingly scarce and expensive ().P runoff from agriculture is also an important water pollutant ().

## The Story of Phosphorus
phosphorus throughout the entire food production and consumption system: the global phosphorus flows analysis found that only 20% of phosphorus in phosphate rock mined for food production actually reaches the food consumed by the global population due toPhosphate RockPhosphate rock preparation generates some dry particulate matter during drying,grinding,and transferring of the rock.These emissions are controlled by wet scrubbers and baghouses.The atmospheric emissions and control methods for the production processes are shown in Table 31.7.

## Phosphate
In chemistry,a phosphate is an anion,salt,functional group or ester derived from a phosphoric acid.It most commonly means orthophosphate,a derivative of orthophosphoric acid H 3PO 4.The phosphate or orthophosphate ion [PO 4]3− is derived from phosphoric acid by the removal of three protons H+.Removal of one or two protons gives the.Rock Phosphates in Agriculture Experimental Agriculture …&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;Hong Qing,Hu Xue Yuan,Li Jung Fu,Liu Feng Lin,Xu Jung,Liu and Fan,Liu 1996.The effect of direct application of phosphate rock on increasing crop yield and improving properties of red soil.Nutrient Cycling in Agroecosystems,Vol.46,Issue.3,p.235.
