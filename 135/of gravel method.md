## Velocity measurement of water flow within gravel layer with.
Our results show that the virtual boundary conditions method,when used to measure water flow velocity within a gravel layer,predicts the flow velocity more rationally than the pulse boundary and dye tracer methods,and with greater precision.Gravel PackUnder the casing gravel pack completion condition,the wire wrapped screen matching the grain size of sand produced and the gravel size matching the reservoir rock grain composition should be selected.The selection principle is that not only can reservoir sand be retained,but also the gravel pack bed has a higher permeable property.

## Choosing an optimum sand control method
Gravel pack method.Gravel pack is a common sand control technique used in many formations with unconsolidated or poorly consolidated sands.Sand production can often be readily achieved by proper sizing of the gravel with respect to formation sand size using well established rules.Sometimes,well consolidated formations can produce sand and.SAE J4003&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Summary of Method—The test consists of projecting standardized road gravel by means of a controlled air blast onto a suitable test panel.The testing apparatus is called a gravelometer,designed to contain road gravel,a test panel holder,and a gravel projecting mechanism.

## Mining Techniques for Sand &amp; Gravel Sciencing
The U.S.Environmental Protection Agency describes sand and gravel as granulated material that results &quot;from the natural disintegration of rock or stone.&quot; The deposits of these materials are generally near the surface of the Earth and in wet areas.The locations are suitable for open pit mining and dredging.gravel packing in casing cnkiThe gravel packing in casing is a effective method to prevent sand production.The gravel packing method can be divided into two kinds according different carrier fluids,i.e.gravel packing with water and colloidal solution.This paper compares and analyses such two.
