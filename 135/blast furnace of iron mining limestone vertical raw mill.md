## Steel mill
A steel mill or steelworks is an industrial plant for the manufacture of steel.It may be an integrated steel works carrying out all steps of steelmaking from smelting iron ore to rolled product,but may also describe plants where steel semi finished casting products (blooms,ingots,slabs,billets) are made,from molten pig iron or from scrap.Blast furnaceA blast furnace is a type of metallurgical furnace used for smelting to produce industrial metals,generally pig iron,but also others such as lead or copper.Blast refers to the combustion air being &quot;forced&quot; or supplied above atmospheric pressure.In a blast furnace,fuel (),ores,and flux are continuously supplied through the top of the furnace,while a hot blast
