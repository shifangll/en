## Anemometer
When the wind blows horizontally,it presses on and moves the ball; because ping pong balls are very lightweight,they move easily in light winds.Measuring the angle between the string ball apparatus and the vertical gives an estimate of the wind speed.Inertial Navigation System (INS)refers to the aircraft,or the neutral aircraft position (pitch,roll and yaw axes),to which a strap down inertial navigation system is firmly attached.Inertial Reference System (IRS) refers to a solid state unit of three Ring Laser Gyros detecting accelerations in 3
