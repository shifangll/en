## Locations of Deposits
Thorium is typically found in the minerals thorite,thorianite and monazite however monazite is the only mineral from which Thorium is currently mined.These monazite deposits are found in placer deposits.India and the United States currently have the mostMonazite: Mineral information,data and localities.[Monazite (Ce)] Overstreet,William C.1967,The Geologic Occurrence of Monazite,United States Geological Survey Professional Paper,Volume 530,p.292.ⓘ Pomba pit No reference listed

Monazite has also been mined as a byproduct from offshore deposits along the southeast coast of the United States,from North Carolina to Florida.Inland and offshore deposits are known to exist in many states,but they are small,low grade deposits when compared …Environmental Risks of MiningMining is an inherently invasive process that can cause damage to a landscape in an area much larger than the mining site itself.The effects of this damage can continue years after a mine has shut down,including the addition to greenhouse gasses,death of flora and fauna,and erosion of land and habitat.

Monazite is produced in large volume in the eastern United States as a by product from heavy mineral sands mining.Today,this valuable material is stockpiled,sold to China,or returned to the mining pit from where it was extracted.NeodymiumThe main mining areas are in China,United States,Brazil,India,Sri Lanka,and Australia.The reserves of neodymium are estimated at about eight million tonnes.Although it belongs to the rare earth metals,neodymium is not rare at all.

Monazite derived from bedrock sources in the piedmont has been found in small quantities in all of the Coastal Plain formations,but the tenor is too low to warrant mining for this mineral alone.At favored localities,however,commercial deposits of heavy minerals may be found,similar to those now being mined in Florida,that may yield monazite as a byproduct.Rare earths: A review of the landscape&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;The United States was the primary producer of rare earths until the 1980s,when China first started producing rare earths.China has since then become the world’s largest producer of rare earths,producing 130,000 mt in 2015.As recently as 2015,when it
