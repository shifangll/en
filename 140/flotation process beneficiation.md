## Beneficiation
In the mining industry or extractive metallurgy,beneficiation is any process that improves (benefits) the economic value of the ore by removing the gangue minerals,which results in a higher grade product (concentrate) and a waste stream (tailings).What Is Iron Ore Beneficiation? (with pictures)&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;Hematite,however,responds better to the flotation process in iron ore beneficiation than magnetite,so it is the preferred type of ore.It responds best to what is known as gravity separation as well and several types of gravity equipment can be used to refine it and.
