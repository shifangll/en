## Cement Clinker Calcination in Cement Production Process …
The cement clinker calcination is an important step in the cement production process.It mainly occurs in cement kiln and can be roughly divided into six reaction stages,namely drying,preheating,chemical decomposition,exothermic reaction,sintering and cooling.CementCement powder,here conditioned in bag,is mixed with fine and coarse aggregates and water.A cement is a binder,a substance used for construction that sets,hardens,and adheres to other materials to bind them together.Cement is seldom used on its own,but rather to bind sand and gravel (aggregate) together.Cement mixed with fine aggregate.
