## Calcium Carbonate (Limestone) Mosaic Crop Nutrition
Calcium carbonate,the chief component of limestone,is a widely used amendment to neutralize soil acidity and to supply calcium (Ca) for plant nutrition.The term “lime” can refer to several products,but for agricultural use it generally refers to ground limestone.Crain's Petrophysical Handbook Visual Analysis Of LithologyVisual determination of lithology (in addition to identifying shale as discussed earlier) is done by noting the quantity of density neutron separation and or by noting absolute values of the photo electric curve.The rules take a little memory work.
