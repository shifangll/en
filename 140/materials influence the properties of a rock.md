## Ductility (Earth science)
In Earth science,as opposed to Materials Science,Ductility refers to the capacity of a rock to deform to large strains without macroscopic fracturing.[1] Such behavior may occur in unlithified or poorly lithified sediments,in weak materials such as halite or at greater depths in all rock types where higher temperatures promote crystal.How does parent material affect soil fertility?However,in the initial stage of soil formation,the soil properties are governed by the nature of parent material but with the time the influence of parent material on soil properties gradually.
