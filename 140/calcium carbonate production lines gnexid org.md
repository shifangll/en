## Calcium
Calcium is a chemical element with the symbol Ca and atomic number 20.As an alkaline earth metal,calcium is a reactive metal that forms a dark oxide nitride layer when exposed to air.Its physical and chemical properties are most similar to its heavier homologues strontium and barium.It is the fifth most abundant element in Earth's crust.CarbonCarbon (from Latin: carbo &quot;coal&quot;) is a chemical element with the symbol C and atomic number 6.It is nonmetallic and tetravalent—making four electrons available to form covalent chemical bonds.It belongs to group 14 of the periodic table.[13] Three isotopes occur naturally,12C and 13C being stable,while 14C is a radionuclide,decaying.
