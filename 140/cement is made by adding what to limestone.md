## Cement clinker
Cement clinker is a solid material produced in the manufacture of Portland cement as an intermediary product.Clinker occurs as lumps or nodules,usually 3 millimetres (0.12 in) to 25 millimetres (0.98 in) in diameter.It is produced by sintering (fusing together without melting to the point of liquefaction) limestone and aluminosilicate materials such as clay during the cement kiln stage.True or False: Concrete can be made by mixing powdered …To make concrete,first you need to make the cement (or mortar) that holds the concrete together.The Romans did this by burning limestone (which is mostly calcium carbonate CaCO 3) to create something called quick lime (calcium oxide CaO).

## Making Limestone Into Cement
3 Ways To Make Cement Wikihow.Oct 27 2017 If the limestone has been baked for long enough it should have a dry crumbly consistency Put on a pair of work gloves and use your hands to crumble the cooled limestone into a fine powder The resulting powder is cement which you can mix with water sand and gravel to make concrete.View Details Send EnquiryCementHydraulic cement is made from finely ground “clinker,” which consists of the calcium silicate minerals formed when limestone and other materials are burned at very high temperatures in a kiln.The term,“hydraulic,” refers to cement’s ability to set and harden

## use of calcium carbonate in cement making
Limestone,as used by the minerals industry,is any rock composed mostly of calcium carbonate (CaCO 3).Although limestone is common in many parts of the United States,it is critically absent from some.Limestone is used to produce Portland cement,as aggregate in concrete and asphalt,and in an enormous array of other products,making it a.Lime (material) Wikipedia202055&ensp&#0183&enspLime is a calciumcontaining inorganic mineral composed primarily of oxides,and hydroxide,usually calcium oxide and or calcium hydroxide.It is also the name for calcium oxide which occurs as a product of coalseam fires and in altered limestone xenoliths in volcanic ejecta.The word lime originates with its earliest use as building mortar and has the sense of sticking or adhering.
