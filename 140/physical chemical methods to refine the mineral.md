## Gold Refining Methods,Wohlwill process,Miller …
The Wohlwill and Miller processes are the two main methods used to refine gold today.The Wohlwill process creates gold to a high level of purity (99.999 percent).It is an electrochemical process that was invented by Emil Wohlwill in 1875.Physical and chemical coal cleaning: AIP Conference.Coal is cleaned industrially by freeing the occluded mineral impurities and physically separating the coal and refuse particles on the basis of differences in density,settling characteristics,or surface properties.While physical methods are very effective and low in cost when applied to the separation of coarse particles,they are much less effective when applied to the separation of fine.

## What are physical methods of separating mixtures
there are a number of physical methods,these involve no chemical change to the compound such as derivatisation.however i think phase changes are still ok for physical separation methods.some.Natural Sciences Grade 92015 9 3&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;The methods mentioned so far are all physical separation methods.Sometimes they are sufficient to separate minerals for use,like coal or iron ore.But more often the element that we are looking for is found as a chemical compound,and so will have to be separated by further chemical reactions.For example,copper in Cu 2 S or aluminium in Al.
