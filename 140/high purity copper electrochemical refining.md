## How can electrolysis be used to purify copper? Socratic
Electrolysis of copper transfers copper atoms from an impure copper anode to a pure copper cathode,leaving the impurities behind Unrefined copper is about 99 % pure It contains traces of metals such as Fe,Zn,Ag,Au,and Pt The purity can be increased to 9995 % by electrolytic refining in a cell similar to that shown belowElectrorefining of CopperElectrorefining of Copper 1.Electrorefining General Introduction In an electrorefining process,the anode is the impure metal and the impurities must be lost during the passage of the metal from the anode to the cathode during electrolysis,i.e.the electrode
