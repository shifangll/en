## Mill (grinding)
SAG is an acronym for semi autogenous grinding.SAG mills are autogenous mills that also use grinding balls like a ball mill.A SAG mill is usually a primary or first stage grinder.SAG mills use a ball charge of 8 to 21%.The largest SAG mill is 42' (12.8m) in diameter,poweredTorque limiting couplings Driveline intelligencetorque limiting couplings ensures smooth operation and less wear and tear during the entire life span.3 Rolling mill.4 Tugboat.3 1 4 2.Fatigue curve (S­N curve) Calibration curve (Calibration diagram) Typical release curve Load cycle 10 10 2 10 4 10 6 10 8 SafeSet Shear pin coupling Torque
