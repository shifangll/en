## How Is Granite Extracted? Sciencing
How Is Granite Extracted?.Granite can be a mixture of mainly quartz and feldspar but also may contain mica.How It Is Extracted.Granite usually occurs in large deposits,many times referred to as slabs,throughout the world.Mining operations use different methods of cutting to extract the different deposits from the ground in places.Tin Geoscience AustraliaThe main method of mining large placer tin deposits is by bucket line dredging.The alluvium containing the tin is excavated and transported by a continuous chain of buckets to the interior of the dredge where it is washed and roughly concentrated.
