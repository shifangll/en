The hydrothermal model proposes that gold entered the basin via the permeable conglomerate horizons via hydrothermal activity and was precipitated out,around the pyrite and uranium.Evidence for this is the dendritic appearance of some of the gold nuggets,and lack of gold in the proposed source rock preserved in the placer deposits.Pyrite Mineral Uses and PropertiesPyrite,the mineral commonly called fool's gold,may have misled a number of gold miners over the years who confused it for the real thing,but a piece of good quality pyrite is a must have treasure for your feng shui collection of crystals and stones.Officially known as iron disulfide,pyrite is a wonderful shiny mineral that instantly wakes up any space.
