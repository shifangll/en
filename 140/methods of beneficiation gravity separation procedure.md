## (PDF) Gravity Separation: Old Technique New Methods
Nowadays,modern gravity separation technologies for the recovery of fines are based on methods using centrifugal forces for separation,which can be adapted for processing slimes of lead vanadate.Flotation ore dressing BritannicaThere are a few methods that employ foams to achieve separations.In these,the principle of separation is adsorption on gas bubbles or at the gas liquid interface.Two of these methods are foam fractionation,for the separation of molecular species,and flotation
