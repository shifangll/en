Calculation of Water Quantity for Concrete As you can see from the Chart,the W C Ratio varies from 0.4 to 0.7 depending on exposure conditions.If we need to calculate Water quantity for concrete,first find the cement content for the volume.If we Assume theConcrete Mix Design Concrete Construction AggregateDesign of Concrete Mix by Indian Standard Method,Design Procedure Slump used Required average strength used Fractional Volume of oven dry rodded course aggregate Dry weight of course aggregate per yd of concrete First estimate of mixing water Void content in fine aggregate Mixing water adjustment Total mixing water required per yd of.
