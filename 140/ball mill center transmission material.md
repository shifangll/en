## Synthesis of graphene nanoflakes by grinding natural.
Natural graphite is a soft material that conventional milling methods fail to grind into nanoparticles.We found that adding NaCl into graphite during milling allows obtaining graphene nanoflakes of about 50&#215;200nm 2 as evidenced by Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM).NaCl particles are substantially brittle and harder
