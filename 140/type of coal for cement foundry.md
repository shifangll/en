## Study on Type C Coal Fly ash as an Additive to Molding …
Abstract Study of physio chemical properties studies such as granulometric analysis,moisture,X ray fluorescence etc.were performed with Type C coal—combustion fly ash to investigate their potential as a distinct option for molding sand in foundry,thereby reducing the dependency on latter.What would be the replacement of concrete?Producing cement uses a great deal of energy,so finding a waste product that can substitute for cement makes good environmental sense.To varying degrees,cement substitutes work in two ways: • First,they hydrate and cure like portland cement.•.
