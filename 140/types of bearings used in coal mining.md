## ITP Mining: Water Use in Industries of the Future: Mining.
Water use in coal mining varies according to the method of mining,the equipment used.In most types of mining,relatively little water is used in actual ore pro­ duction.A notable exception is underground coal mining,where water is used as one of sev­ eral measures to reduce the hazard of fires or explosions.Because of this,water and energy are related at the mine site in two ways.Coal Products Makomo ResourcesCoal Products Makomo produces various types of coal products,which supply Zimbabwe’s power stations,and industrial and agricultural sectors.
