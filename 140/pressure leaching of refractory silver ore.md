## Treatment of Alaskan Refractory Gold and Silver Or
The US Bureau of Mines investigated treatment of gold and silver refractory ores and concentrates that respond poorly to conventional cyanidation techniques owing to the complex mineralogy of the ore Three types of ores were investigated: gold locked placer sands,gold locked in sulfides,and.Alternative lixiviants to cyanide for leaching gold ores,Fleming et al (2003) considered that pressure leaching followed by thiosulfate leaching was possibly economic,although in this case the variability of the ore caused significant differences in gold recovery High reagent consumptions can obviously be tolerated where ores are refractory to cyanide,such as preg robbing carbonaceous or

## Improving the gold leaching process of refractory ores,
Refractory gold ores have poor gold recoveries with direct cyanide leaching Typically the refractoriness is due to encapsulation of the gold particles inside the host mineralHigh Gold and Silver Recoveries Enabled by Albion Process,Challenges of refractory gold and silver,grinding of ore material followed by oxidative leaching at atmospheric pressure This makes for more complete leaching,

## Effect of Manganese on Silver Leaching
In Mexico and elsewhere there are large bodies of valuable silver ore containing manganese which present great,and hitherto insuperable,obstacles to a satisfactory extraction by cyanide.The proportion of the silver that is soluble in cyanide varies greatly and may.Gold Extraction and Recovery ProcessesFor refractory ores such as sulfide ores and carbonaceous ores which are not susceptible to direct cyanide leaching,various methods such as pressure oxidation,roasting,chlorination,biooxidation etc are available to treat these ores to expose the gold particles before cyanidation Thioura leaching was developed as a potential
