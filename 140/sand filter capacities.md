How do I choose a filter? Your choice of fi lter should be based around: Filtration technology: sand,cartridge and diatomaceous earth filters that determine water clarity and therefore bathing comfort.Required flow: to determine this value,consider that an average of 4 to 6 hours should be sufficient to replace the entire volume of pool water.Backwash WaterThe filter feed pump transports effluent from the filter feed tank to the sand filter.The suspended solids present in the wastewater get trapped in the sand media,and clear water goes to ACF for further treatment.Online NaOCl dosing is achieved via the inlet feed.
