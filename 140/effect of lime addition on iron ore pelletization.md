AbstractThe effect of lime and silica addition on the reducibility,of sintered iron ore and synthetic hematite pellets was investigated The addition of lime and or silica (up to about 10% total) to sintered synthetic hematite pellets has little effect on the reducibility at 900&#176;C Lime additions (with or without silica) lower the reducibility of sintered hematite and magnetite ore pelletsIron Ore Pelletization Packing Machines Electrostatic,Iron ore pellets are superior to iron ore lumps in the subsequent iron making processes such as Blast furnace,DR furnace etc Iron ore pellets with a nominal 64 67% Fe,uniform porosity and better size help in faster reduction and higher metallization rates than the conventional iron ore lumps
