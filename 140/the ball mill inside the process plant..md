## Optimization of mill performance by using
Mill power Usually,plant operators use mill power readings as an indicator of ball filling degree and,often,try to keep it at the maximum level.It is well known that the mill absorbed power depends on operating parameters other than ball level,such as pulp density and liner configuration.FCalculate Ball Mill Grinding CapacityA) Total Apparent Volumetric Charge Filling including balls and excess slurry on top of the ball charge,plus the interstitial voids in between the balls expressed as a percentage of the net internal mill volume (inside liners).B) Overflow Discharge Mills operating at low ball fillings slurry may accumulate on top of the ball charge;

## Ball Mills
In the ball mill process,lead ball (cylinders) or ingots can be subjected to oxidation.The lead balls are fed into a large steel drum that rotates around its horizontal axis.Within the rotating drum the lead pieces (balls) rub and strike against each other.Pumping up gold production rates at Greenfields MillFor over twenty years,the site has provided first class toll milling to the local gold mining industry.The plant has a unique setup with three ball mills,allowing the circuit to be optimised for gold recovery depending on the needs of different clients.In its current configuration,the plant can process up to one million tonnes per annum.
