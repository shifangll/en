The overall process of conversion from raw meal to clinker being endothermic demands a theoretical heat of about 380 420 kcal kg clinker However,the rest of the specific heat consumption as tabulated above constitutes heat losses from preheater exhaust gases,clinker,cooler exhaust gases,preheater dust and radiation lossCement Analysis IEAClinker is the main ingredient in cement,and the amount used is directly proportional to the CO 2 emissions generated in cement manufacturing,due to both the combustion of fuels and the decomposition of limestone in the clinker production process From 2014 to 2018,the clinker to cement ratio increased at an average of 16% per year,reaching an estimated 070 in 2018; this rise,

## Manufacturing
Manufacturing the cement kiln Most Portland cement is made in a rotary kiln.Basically,this is a long cylinder rotating about its axis once every minute or two.The axis is inclined at a slight angle,the end with the burner being lower.The rotation causes the raw.CEMENT PRODUCTION AND QUALITY CONTROL A Cement,is decomposed and clinker minerals are formed,the cooler where by the hot clinker is cooled down and crushed by hammer crusher The energy required for pyroprocessing is satisfied by firing coal at calciner and kiln main burner The coal is dried and ground to the required moisture content and size before being fired in the process

## What Is the Cement Manufacturing Process? (with pictures)
The cement manufacturing process is completed when the cooled clinker is ground once again in a rotating finishing mill A combination of gypsum and limestone will usually be added in small amounts to the heated cement during this last grinding step,and coloring agents can also be added here The fineness of the finished particles will vary according to individual preferences,and the cement.types of cement manufacturing process pptPortland Cement Types,manufacturing functions of There are 2 chief aspects of the manufacturing process: First To produce a finely divided mixture of raw materials chalk limestone and clay shale.Second.To heat this mixture to produce.
