## Electrolytic Refining
Electro refining Usually the object of electrolytic refining is to separate one metal in pure form from an alloy containing a high percentage of the desired metal,copper for instance,and a number of other metals dissolved in the copper or intimately mixed with it.Chapter 82Electrolytic processing of desulphurized calcine consists of three basic steps: leaching,purification and electrolysis.A mixture of aluminium powder and a metal oxide powder (iron,copper,etc.) is ignited in a crucible,producing molten metal with the The.

## Industrial: Powder Metallurgy
Electrolytic copper powder is produced by following principles used in electroplating with the conditions changed to produce a loose powdery deposit rather than a smooth adherently solid layer.The formation of powder deposits that adhere loosely to the cathode is favored by low copper ion concentration in the electrolyte,high acid concentration and high cathode current density.IronIron ( ˈaɪərn ) is a chemical element with symbol Fe (from Latin: ferrum) and atomic number 26.It is a metal that belongs to the first transition series and group 8 of the periodic table.It is by mass the most common element on Earth,forming much of Earth's outer and inner core.It is the fourth most common element in the Earth's crust.
