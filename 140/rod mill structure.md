Rod mills operate at lower speed than ball mills since the rods are rolled and not cascaded.For an equivalent grind,a rod mill uses less steel than a ball mill because of the lower speed and better contact between the media and ore.The rod charge must be maintained in good working condition,and broken and worn rods must be removed.Rimjhim IspatRimJhim Ispat has composite facilities which includes steel melting shop,wire rod rolling mill,round bar structure rolling mill,bright bar plants,wire drawing and HR CR coils,plates mill (under commissioning).read more Our Products Wire Rods Wire &amp; Fine Wire.
