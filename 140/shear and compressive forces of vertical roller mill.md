## Shear Case
&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;Vertical roller mills (VRM) have been around since the early 1900s and are accepted technology in the cement,power,and industrial minerals industries.However,there are very few examples of applications in the mining industry to date.The main components of a VRM are shown in Figure 8.19.Breakage in a VRM occurs by comimpact and attrition force in hammer millMay 27,2013.Grinders (a) Impact mill Hammer mill (b) Rolling compression Roller mill ( c) Attrition mill.In ball mill,impact or attrition or both responsible for size reduction.Shearing force is also involved during the movement of stones.Read More

## Shear stresses and material slip in high pressure roller mills
The compaction of the particle bed in a high pressure roller mill causes pressure and shear forces on the rollers,which have been measured simultaneously with a sensor.As known,the pressure peak arises short above the gap neck,the shear is firstly orientated against and then in the rotation direction.
