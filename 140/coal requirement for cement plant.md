## Regarding specific heat consumption (Kcal Kg of Clinker.
Generally speaking,the use of petcoke results in a higher specific heat consumption than coal.This is primarily due to the higher O2 levels required in the kiln inlet to prevent build ups and blockages resulting from the very high sulphur content of petcoke (usually up to 7% as S).India: cement industry demand raises coal importsThe demand for coal with a high calorific value,primarily from the cement sector,combined with the doubling of clean environment cess has resulted in a shift in coal imports into India.Steam coal imports have been declining in the April June 2016 quarter due to.

## Cement Manufacturing Process Phases Flow Chart.
 · Generally cement plants are fixed where the quarry of limestone is near bye.This saves the extra fuel cost and makes cement somehow economical.Raw materials are extracted from the quarry and by means of conveyor belt material is transported to the cement plant.There are also various other raw materials used for cement manufacturing.Emissions from the Cement Industry · Cement manufacturing is highly energy and emissions intensive because of the extreme heat required to produce it.Producing a ton of cement requires 4.7 million BTU of energy,equivalent to about 400 pounds of coal,and generates nearly a ton of CO 2.Given its high emissions and critical importance to society,cement is an obvious place to.
