## How to Identify Valuable Rocks Sciencing
Color is important,but by itself,color does not positively identify a mineral.The classic example is iron pyrite,which has a color that resembles gold so closely that people call it fool's gold.Color does help identify some rocks,such as the monochromatic azurite.5.2 Chemical Weathering Physical Geology5.2 Chemical Weathering Chemical weathering results from chemical changes to minerals that become unstable when they are exposed to surface conditions.The kinds of changes that take place are highly specific to the mineral and the environmental conditions.
