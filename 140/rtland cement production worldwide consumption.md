## Energy consumption assessment in a cement production …
Energy consumption assessment in a cement production plant is studied in this paper and a guideline for reducing energy consumption is provided according to a national standard ISIRI 7873.Based on energy assessment,several energy saving actions were.Cement Tracking Industry AnalysisDemand for cement in the construction industry drives production,and thus it is an important determinant of cement subsector energy consumption and CO 2 emissions.Initial estimates suggest that cement production returned to 4.1 gigatonnes (Gt) globally in 2018,a 1% increase following annual declines of 1% during 2014‑17.

cement production is as low as $6 per tonne in China as opposed to $30 per tonne in Nigeria; this has contributed largely to the high and persistent rise in unit cost of ce ment production.There is thus the need for the adoption of energy efficiency in cementConsumption&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;“This allows for production and distribution of green cement with a greatly reduced clinker factor,38% lower CO 2 emissions and 30% of the energy consumption of ordinary Portland cement (OPC) production,” he said.Published in Global Cement News.

## Portland cement
Portland cement is the most common type of cement in general use around the world as a basic ingredient of concrete,mortar,stucco,and non specialty grout.It was developed from other types of hydraulic lime in England in the mid 19th century,and usually originates from limestone.The Greenhouse Gas Emission from Portland Cement …&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;The typical CaCO 3 content in limestone is about 65%,based on chemical Equation (1),and it can be calculated that it will generate 0.44 kg CO 2 per kg consumption of CaCO 3.Therefore,in the cement production phase,CO 2 emissions from decomposition can be calculated as: 65% times 0.44 kg is 0.2860 kg.
