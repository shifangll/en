## What is the chemical equation for the combustion of coal.
The chemical equation for the combustion of coal is C + O2 = CO2.In this equation,C represents the carbon in the coal,which reacts with air,represented by O2,to.CHE 31 INTRODUCTION TO CHEMICAL ENGINEERING,Example 11 4 Combustion of Coal Moisture in the fuel was 390% and the air on the average contained 00048 lbm H 2O lbm dry air The refuse showed 140% combined elements as in the coal (ie C,H,O,N,S) and the remainder being ash It may be assumed that these combined elements occur in the same proportions as they do in the coal
