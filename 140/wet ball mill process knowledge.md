## Ball Mill Wet Process
Ball Mill,Overflow Ball Mill,Grid Ball Mill 5 &#183; ball mill is the key equipment for grinding after the crushing process.adopts double heart roller bearings,horizontal cylinder.also can be used for the dry and wet grinding for all kinds of ores and otherBall MillsIn the ball mill process,lead ball (cylinders) or ingots can be subjected to oxidation.The lead balls are fed into a large steel drum that rotates around its horizontal axis.Within the rotating drum the lead pieces (balls) rub and strike against each other.

## A discussion on the measurement of grinding media wear.
A discussion on the measurement of grinding media wear.One of the major problems regarding the use of ball mills is to balance the size distribution of grinding media into the mill.Whereas,crushing is a dry process,grinding is usually a wet process.Dry grinding is only used when water is scarce or it is important not to wet the.Crystallinity and surface state of cellulose in wet ball.We report the effect of wet ball milling process under mild neutral salt conditions on the alteration of crystallinity and surface state of microcrystalline cellulose (MC).The ball milling experiments were performed when the MC was immersed in H 2 O,NaCl aqueous solution,and KCl aqueous solution.
