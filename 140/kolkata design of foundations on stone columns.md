What is stone columns? Why it is required? It is a technique adopted for the soil which didn’t have the sufficient characteristics to permit construction.The stone column technique,also known as vibro replacement or vibro displacement,is a ground improvement process where vertical columns of compacted aggregate are formed through the soils to be improved.Missouri University of Science and Technology Scholars' MineProceedings: Third International Conference on Case Histories in Geotechnical Engineering,St.Louis,Missouri,June 4,1993,Paper No.1.21 Failure of Foundation Systems Using Stone Columns A.Verghese Chummar Managing Director,F.S.Engineers
