## Understanding Size Effects of Semi autogenous Grinding.
&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;&quot;Although it is well known and easily experienced that the feed size distribution influences the throughput and stability of operation of a semi autogenous grinding (SAG) mill,the details are poorly understood since it is often only the input and output measurements that are used to identify unfavourable in mill conditions.The SAG grindability index testTherefore,as long as they are already finer than the SAG mill classifier slots and the SAG mill throughput is limited by the size reduction of the coarse,plus grate size material,then passing some of them through the SAG mill one more time before sending them
