The cement clinker calcination is an important step in the cement production process.It mainly occurs in cement kiln and can be roughly divided into six reaction stages,namely drying,preheating,chemical decomposition,exothermic reaction,sintering and cooling.How Portland Cement is Made? Manufacturing Process of …Portland cement can be made by following two different processes a dry one and a wet one.Joseph Aspdin first made portland cement in his kitchen stove in England in the 19th century.Lime and silica make up approximately 85% of portland cement.The materials that are commonly used are limestone,shells,chalk,shale,clay,slate,silica sand,and iron ore.Since limestone is the main.

## Cement Kilns: Wet and semi wet process kilns
Kiln lengths,in fact,ultimately reached over 230 m.The development in the late 1920s of internal kiln heat exchangers (mainly in the form of chains) considerably improved the efficiency of the wet process,and dry process kilns almost disappeared by 1930.Manufacturing the cement kiln Understanding CementWet process kilns The original rotary cement kilns were called 'wet process' kilns In their basic form they were relatively simple compared with modern developments The raw meal was supplied at ambient temperature in the form of a slurry A wet process kiln may be up to 200m long and 6m in diameter

## Cement Production
Manufacturing cement at the Lafarge Seattle plant is by a “wet process”.As a result,raw materials are mixed with 30 to 40% water during grinding to form well mixed slurry.This wet process is advantageous due to the increased compatibility with wet climates and more uniform blending of raw materials prior to the kiln,along with lower kiln dust emissions.INDUSTRIAL CASE STUDY THE EMENT INDUSTRY3 CEMENT PRODUCTION PROCESS AND ENERGY USE 31 INTRODUCTION Cement is an inorganic,non metallic substance with hydraulic binding properties,and is used as a bonding agent in building materials It is a fine powder,usually gray in color,that consists of a mixture of the hydraulic cement minerals to which one or more forms of calcium sulfate have
