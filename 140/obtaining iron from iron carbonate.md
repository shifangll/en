## Carbon Steel vs Cast Iron Frying Pans Which is Best?
 · Awesome article! I love both my cast iron and my carbon steel stuff.I did notice one mistake though,you said iron is a killer heat conductor it’s actually a terrible heat conductor compared to many other cooking metals (Copper at 401 W m.k,Aluminum at 237,carbon steel at 90 and iron at 80) that’s why it takes so long to heat up!Carbonate WikipediaIn chemistry,a carbonate is a salt of carbonic acid (H 2 CO 3),characterized by the presence of the carbonate ion,a polyatomic ion with the formula of CO 2− 3.The name may also refer to a carbonate ester,an organic compound containing the carbonate group C(=O)(O ) 2.
