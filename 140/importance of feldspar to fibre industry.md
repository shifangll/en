## Feldspar Distinctions,Characteristics & Identification
 · For general purposes,like picking granite for a countertop,it doesn't matter what type of feldspar is in a rock.For geological purposes,feldspars are quite important.For rockhounds without laboratories,it's enough to be able to tell the two main types of feldspar,plagioclase (PLADGE yo clays) feldspar and alkali feldspar.Feldspar minerals make up over 50% of Earth's crust.Feldspar in rocks: This chart summarizes the mineral compositions of common igneous rocks.It clearly shows that feldspar minerals are important constituents of granite,diorite and gabbro these rock types make up the majority of Earth's crust.

## The FOA Reference For Fiber Optics
Since the fibers are long,the attenuation of the fiber is an important part of the measured loss.Since the attenuation coefficient of the fiber is dependent on the wavelength of the light source,small differences in the wavelength of a test source (in either an OLTS or OTDR) can lead to …
