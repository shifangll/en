## Geology
Geology describes the structure of the Earth on and beneath its surface,and the processes that have shaped that structure.It also provides tools to determine the relative and absolute ages of rocks found in a given location,and also to describe the histories of those rocks.Compressive strength of rocksMechanical failure in rocks generally means either fracturing or permanent deformation as a result of compression.While many methods for calculating failure relationships exist,an initial measure of the compressive strength of reservoir rocks is still needed for use in those calculations.
