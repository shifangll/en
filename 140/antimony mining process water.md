Significant water flows were encountered during mining from the mining faces and cross veins of quartz that were encountered,causing the added expense of keeping the underground mines open.Ores produced from the mines were not concentrated,except by hand labor in a process called hand cobbing; therefore,only high grade ores were mined.Gold Smelting & Refining ProcessFeb 28,2016&#0183;&#32;Other process used for a long time is the Wohlwill Process and is considered as the second part of the Miller process due to refine its product This is an electrolytic process based on the dissolution of gold in an acid bath prepared with chlorine gas and hydrochloric ac The final product is a gold cathode with 9999% purity
