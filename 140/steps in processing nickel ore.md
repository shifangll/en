## How copper is made
The process of extracting copper from copper ore varies according to the type of ore and the desired purity of the final product.Each process consists of several steps in which unwanted materials are physically or chemically removed,and the.A New Process for Cobalt Nickel SeparationA New Process for Co Ni Separation ALTA 2010 5 a high Ni:Co ratio,sufficient to satisfy cobalt purity requirements for LME Grade Nickel.This extraction is achieved using a synergistic mixture of Versatic 10 and LIX 63.There are two basic steps involved,as in

## Copper Mining and Processing: Processing of Copper …
Copper processing is a complicated process that begins with mining of the ore (less than 1% copper) and ends with sheets of 99.99% pure copper called cathodes,which will ultimately be made into products for everyday use.The most common types of ore,copper oxide and copper sulfide,undergo two different processes,hydrometallurgy and pyrometallurgy,respectively,due to the different.From Ore to Finished ProductThe first step in processing the ore removed from the mine is to break the large rocks of ore into smaller pieces.This is accomplished by a variety of subsequent processing steps.4.Beneficiation of Copper Ore The next step in processing is called beneficiation.
