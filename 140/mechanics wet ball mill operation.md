## Analysis of grinding kinetics in a laboratory ball mill.
In addition to the ball mill,simulation of various milling equipment such as centrifugal mill,stirred mill and planetary mill were also studied.For example,Mori et al.studied the correlation between impact energy and grinding rate for a wet ball mill and reported that the grinding rate can be predicted through the measured impact energy.Ball millThe ball mill is used for grinding materials such as coal,pigments,and feldspar for pottery.Grinding can be carried out either wet or dry but the former is performed at low speed.Blending of explosives is an example of an application for rubber balls.
