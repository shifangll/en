## Milling (machining)
Milling is the process of machining using rotary cutters to remove material[1] by advancing a cutter into a work piece.This may be done varying direction[2] on one or several axes,cutter head speed,and pressure.[3] Milling covers a wide variety of different operations and machines,on scales from small individual parts to large,heavy duty.Gold and Tailings: The Standard Mill at Bodie,…10.Indications of the importance of monitoring the gold content in the tailings stream at turn of the 20th century gold milling operations may be seen in Edward B.Preston,California Gold Mill Practices,California State Mining Bureau Bulletin No.6 (Sacramento: State Mining Bureau,1895),48 51; Henry Louis,Handbook of Gold Milling,3rd ed.
