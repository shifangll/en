## Influence of Mulch Material and Mulching Rate
Mulching is beneficial to performance of tomato and can increase soil micro organisms.Mulch types had no effect on fruit yield of tomato.Plants mulched with 15t ha 1 produced the highest yield (23.30t ha) while control plots had the least value (8.13t ha 1).Soil micro organisms (bacterial,fungal) had the best increase at mulching rate of.
