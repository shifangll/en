## Compressive strength of rocks
Mechanical failure in rocks generally means either fracturing or permanent deformation as a result of compression.While many methods for calculating failure relationships exist,an initial measure of the compressive strength of reservoir rocks is still needed for use in those calculations.STRENGTH PROPERTIES OF ROCKS AND ROCK MASSES 1.…In general,rock mass strength depends on the strength of intact rock and the strength of rock discontinuities.In general.avoid crushing that could throw doubts as to the mechanism of failure in the test sample.Strips of paper or steel loading jaws (Figure 4c.
