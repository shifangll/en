## Principle and Working of MILLING.
&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;Introduction: Milling is the cutting operation that removes metal by feeding the work against a rotating,cutter having single or multiple cutting edges.Flat or curved surfaces of many shapes can be machined by milling with good finish and accuracy.A milling machine may also be used for drilling,slotting,making a circular profile and gear cutting by having suitable attachments.DESIGN AND STRUCTURAL ANALYSIS OF CNC VERTICAL MILLING.Swami et al,International Journal of Advanced Engineering Technology E ISSN 0976 3945 Research Paper DESIGN AND STRUCTURAL ANALYSIS OF CNC VERTICAL MILLING MACHINE BED B.Malleswara Swami1,K.Sunil Ratna Kumar2 Address for Correspondence 1 PG Student,2Assistant Professor Department of Mecha

## Vertical (common size) analysis of financial statements.
Vertical analysis (also known as common size analysis) is a popular method of financial statement analysis that shows each item on a statement as a percentage of a base figure within the statement.To conduct a vertical analysis of balance sheet,the total of assets and the total of liabilities and stockholders’ equity are generally used as base figures.What is Milling Machine&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;Basically the milling machines are divided into two types first is horizontal milling machine and second one is vertical milling machine.They are further classified as knee type,ram type,manufacturing or bed
