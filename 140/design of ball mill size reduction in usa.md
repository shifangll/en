## Ball Mill
Ball mills tumble iron or steel balls with the ore.The balls are initially 5 10 cm diameter but gradually wear away as grinding of the ore proceeds.The feed to ball mills (dry basis) is typically 75 vol. % ore and 25% steel.The ball mill is operated in closed circuit with a particle size measurement device and size control cyclones.Optimization of mill performance by usingOptimization of mill performance by using online ball and pulp measurements Soon after a stop,a mill is a dangerous place to enter for the personnel tasked with taking measurements or samples.Crash stops are difficult to handle.The mill and all feed streams
