## The Benefits of Aluminum Recycling
Recycling aluminum saves 90% to 95% of the energy needed to make aluminum from bauxite ore.It doesn't matter if you're making aluminum cans,roof gutters or cookware,it is simply much more energy efficient to recycle existing aluminum to create theBauxite mining in the United StatesBauxite mining in the United States produced an estimated 128,000 metric tonnes of bauxite in 2013.Although the United States was an important source of bauxite in the early 20th century,it now supplies less than one percent of world bauxite production.

## Mining and Refining Process
The Bayer Process was invented and patented in 1887 by Austrian scientist Karl Josef Bayer.Two to three tonnes of bauxite are required to produce one tonne of alumina.90% of the global alumina supply of around 90 million tonnes is used in aluminium production.Bayer processThe Bayer process is the principal industrial means of refining bauxite to produce alumina (aluminium oxide) and was developed by Carl Josef Bayer.Bauxite,the most important ore of aluminium,contains only 30 60% aluminium oxide (Al 2 O 3),the rest being a mixture of silica,various iron oxides,and titanium dioxide.[1].
