## Fly Ash
Fly ash is a heterogeneous by product material produced in the combustion process of coal used in power stations.It is a fine grey coloured powder having spherical glassy particles that rise with the flue gases.As fly ash contains pozzolanic materials components.FLY ASH CONCRETEFly ash concrete has many benefits over regular concrete like improved strength,durability,more chemical resistant,less segregation,easier to pump,improved workability,and less water needed.Hi,I am Mike Day,owner of Day’s Concrete Floors,Inc.in Maine,where I've been working with concrete for 30 years now,and this website is where I can share with you all the knowledge and wisdom.
