## Methylene blue
Methylene blue has been used as a placebo; physicians would tell their patients to expect their urine to change color and view this as a sign that their condition had improved.[27] This same side effect makes methylene blue difficult to test in traditional placebo []METHYLENE BLUE DYE TESTS ON AGGREGATE …The draft European Standard for aggregates for mortar specifies the methylene blue dye (MB) test for limiting the clay content of an aggregate [2].The test method described is based on the adsorption of a blue,cationic dye by clay minerals and a version of the test method has been applied to a wide selection of UK aggregates for mortars [3].
