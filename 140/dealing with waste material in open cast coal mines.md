## Basics of an open pit mine
Open pit mines can be used in coal mining,and they are used extensively in &quot;hard rock&quot; mining for ores such as metal ores,copper,gold,iron,aluminum,and many minerals.In a open pit coal mine,the pit bottom would be the bottom mined coal seam elevation,since it is usually feasible to extract multiple seams when surface mining coal.Mining WasteOf that,hard coal mining waste comprised 53.3% and metal ore (copper) mining and processing,46.7%.The area of each dump ranges from about 10 to &gt;200 ha for large central dumping sites where waste from several mines has been disposed.
