## Iron ore pelletization ScienceDirect
With the development of the world steel industry,the increasing need for beneficiation due to the depletion of highgrade iron ore resources,and the strict requirements for environment protection,the production of fired pellets will have considerable room to increase,as predicted in Table 15.3 (Mendes,2012).Introduction: overview of the global iron ore industry.Iron ore is the primary raw material from which metallic iron is extracted to make steel.To meet the rapid increase in crude steel production,the last decade has seen major expansions in world iron ore production.As evident in Figure 1.2,the world's iron ore production has increased from 1.043 Bt in 2001 to 2.93 Bt in 2012.China is the.
