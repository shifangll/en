Don't worry about 4Star.It will become common.In the future you can get 10 chance + 1 4Star for 1000 Gems.Don't like random Archetype? There's also BiWeekly system in the game that will give you 150k,that's 300k per month.It's honestly not too bad.NOW,DO YOU WANNA TALK ABOUT 3.5 MILLION MAGNETITE 5STAR FUSION?Effect Of Primary Grind Size On Mineral LiberationThe extrapolated ore fragmentation and copper sulphide liberation plots reveal that the liberation levels and hence the flotation responses of the minerals would be essentially constant across a broad range of flotation feed sizing.This observation would indicate that flotation feed sizing coarser than 200&#181;m K80,the practical norm for copper porphyry ore processing worldwide,could be.
