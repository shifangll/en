## Calcium carbonate
Calcium carbonate is a chemical compound with the formula CaCO3.It is a common substance found in rocks as the minerals calcite and aragonite (most notably as limestone,which is a type of sedimentary rock consisting mainly of calcite) and is the main component of pearls and the shells of marine organisms,snails,and eggs.Calcium carbonate.Precipitated Calcium Carbonate (PCC)Precipitated Calcium Carbonate (PCC) is an innovative product,derived from lime,which has many industrial applications.PCC is made by hydrating high calcium quicklime,and then reacting the resulting slurry,or “milk of lime”,with carbon dioxide.
