## Influence of Machining Parameters on Vibration.
theoretical analysis results,the test platform is set up on the YK7660 gear grinding machine.form By varying the parameters of grinding process,the data of vibration characteristics of gear form grinding is acquired and analyzed.Chatter in a transverse grinding processIn transverse grinding,the wheel moves along the workpiece,which induces unique grinding dynamics.To understand these dynamic phenomena,specifically the grinding chatter,a new dynamical model of the process is proposed,in which the wheel position is.
