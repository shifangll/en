## Rock and Mineral Identification for Engineers
Introduction Civil engineers routinely use rocks as aggregate material in their construction projects.However,many engineers do not have extensive training in rock and mineral identifica tion.This guide,which expands on an article and subse quent publicationsA Description of MagnetiteMagnetite is strongly magnetic.It was used by the ancient Chinese to make the first magnetic compasses.The chemical formula is Fe 3 O 4,commonly called ferrous ferric oxide,and is valuable as an iron ore.Magnetite reacts with oxygen to produce hematite

## Pumice
Pumice ( ˈ p ʌ m ɪ s ),called pumicite in its powdered or dust form,is a volcanic rock that consists of highly vesicular rough textured volcanic glass,which may or may not contain crystals.It is typically light colored.Scoria is another vesicular volcanic rock that differs from pumice in having larger vesicles,thicker vesicle walls and being dark colored and denser.Chemical Composition and Mechanical Properties of Basalt …The influence of geometrical features and chemical composition,in terms of SiO 2 and Al 2 O 3 content,on the mechanical properties of basalt fibers has been investigated in [57],by analysing.
