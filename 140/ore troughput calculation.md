## Sampling in Mineral Processing
What is sampling in mineral processing? Sampling is the procedure by which some members of a population are selected as representative of the entire population for studies and conclusions.In mineral processing,it refers to selecting representitive members of the ore in various space and or time for assays,mineralogical,minerallurgical studies,metallurgical testing,pilot plant testing.Calculate OEE Definitions,Formulas,and Examples OEEPreferred Calculation The preferred OEE calculation is based on the three OEE Factors: Availability,Performance,and Quality.OEE is calculated by multiplying the three OEE factors: Availability,Performance,and Quality.Availability Availability takes into account all events that stop planned production long enough where it makes sense to track a reason for being down (typically several.
