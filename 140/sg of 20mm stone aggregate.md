And Its Limits [Civil Planets]The grading of aggregates is the determination of the aggregate size used for construction works The coarse aggregate is graded as per its size (10mm,12mm & 20mm) The selection of the right coarse aggregate size depends on the specific construction activity You will understand how grading of aggregates influences the bondage in concrete.

Aggregates Are Mainly Classified into Two Categories: 1)Fine aggregate (10mm) and 2) Coarse aggregate (20 mm and 40mm) The fine aggregate is natural sand that has been washed and sieved to remove particles larger than 5 mm,and the coarse aggregate is a gravel that has been crushed,washed and sieved so that the particles vary from 5 to 50 mm.Aggregate (20mm) Building Materials Renovation20191024&ensp&#0183&enspAggregate is a component of composite materials such as concrete and asphalt concrete.It serves as reinforcement (adding strength to the overall composite material),and for forming concrete mortar (by mixing with water,bitumen,Portland cement,lime and gypsum).It is also used as base material under foundations,roads,and railroads.
