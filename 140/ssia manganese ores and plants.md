## Manganese Ore
Manganese ores contain manganese in various oxide forms ranging from MnO 2,Mn 2 O 3,Mn 3 O 4,to MnO.Manganese oxides higher than MnO are unstable and decompose to MnO in the presence of CO below the smelting temperature,and MnO is reduced by.ManganeseManganese is a chemical element with the symbol Mn and atomic number 25.It is not found as a free element in nature; it is often found in minerals in combination with iron.Manganese is a transition metal with a multifaceted array of industrial alloy uses,particularly in stainless steels.Historically,manganese is named for pyrolusite and.

## Manganese
Manganese occurs in nodules on the bottom of the ocean and in most iron ores.The manganese content in coal has been reported to be 6 100 μg g (Ruch et al.1973).Manganese also occurs over a wide range of concentrations as a natural trace element inManganese Ore ProcessingThe problem involved in Manganese Ore Processing deals with the production of acceptable specification grades of manganese concentrates at a maximum recovery of the total manganese from ores having variable characteristics.The flowsheet provides for both.
