## Properties of Concrete Portland Cement Association
The rate of drying during this stage is determined by the quality of the cement paste: low water cement ratio cement paste offers more resistance to vapor diffusion than high water cement ratio paste Concrete made with a water cement ratio,greater than approximately 065,will have a continuously connected capillary pore systemHow to Make Lightweight Fiber Cement HunkerLightweight cement is a cement mixture using lightweight aggregates such as Styrofoam beads or pumice stones as a replacement for heavier gravel aggregate The replacement material is applicable using the same methods as traditional stone aggregate based cement The problem with lightweight cement is in its strength
