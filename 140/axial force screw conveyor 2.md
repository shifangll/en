friction force overcomes the gravitational force of the particles,preventing them from falling.1,2 Although the structure of the vertical screw conveyor and the convey ing principle of the particle are simple,the mechanism of the transport process is very complex.AtScrew JacksA screw jack is a mechanical device that can increase the magnitude of an effort force.The effort force for a screw jack when neglecting friction can be expressed as F = (Q p) (2 π R) (1) where F = effort force at the end of the arm or handle
