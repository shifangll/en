## Rutile
Digitalfire Reference Library (no ads) Notes Rutile is the mineral name for natural crystals of titanium dioxide.However in nature rutile is always contaminated by up to 15% other minerals (especially iron but also things like tantalum,niobium,chromium and tin,the analysis provided here is obviously a simplification of the real picture).RutileNatural rutile may contain up to 10% iron and significant amounts of niobium and tantalum.In large enough quantities in beach sands,rutile forms an important constituent of heavy minerals and ore deposits.Miners extract and separate the valuable minerals—e.g.
