## The Heat Balance and Efficiency of Steam Boilers
Sensible heat in slag Heat in mill rejects Reference : PTC ; 4.1 Sootblowing Efficiency Input = Heat input Output = Input losses 5 Efficiency = Input Output The Heat balance Equation The distribution of the heat supplied to the boiler as useful heat and lost heat.Heat Balance Article about Heat Balance by The Free …Heat balance An application of the first law of thermodynamics to a process in which any work terms are negligible.For a closed system,one that always consists of the same material,the first law is Q + W = ΔE,where Q is the heat supplied to the system,W is the work done on the system,and ΔE is the increase in energy of the material forming the system.
