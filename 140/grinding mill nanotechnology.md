## Ball mill
A ball mill is a type of grinder used to grind,blend and sometimes for mixing of materials for use in mineral dressing processes,paints,pyrotechnics,ceramics and selective laser sintering.It works on the principle of impact and attrition: size reduction iImpact of chloride grinding aid with modified fly ash.However,the grinding efficiency was very poor and also the ground particle agglomeration and re healing of atom fracture surface.Due to this reason,it is difficult to grind the particle to reach ultra fine particles.The important phenomenon of energy consumption is more for ball mill grinding,.To prevail these issues,the chloride.
