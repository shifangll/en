## The Construction and Design of Concrete Slabs on Grade
Sub grade support can be considerably improved by installing a cement treated sub base (soil cement),controlled low strength material (CLSM),or lean concrete sub base.Generally cement treated and lean concrete sub bases are 4 to 6 inches thick.ACompressive Strength of Concrete Cube Test,Procedure,…Compressive strength of concrete depends on many factors such as water cement ratio,cement strength,quality of concrete material,quality control during production of concrete etc.Test for compressive strength is carried out either on cube or cylinder.

## Grade of Concrete
Grade of Concrete is the classification of concrete according to its compressive strength.For making concrete we use cement,sand,aggregate,and water which are mixed with certain ratio and concrete is cast and put in a cube of 150 mm size and put in a water.Strength of Concrete vs Grades of Cementthe fresh mix concrete.The range W C normal from 0.3 to 0.7.Too much water cannot be totally absorbed by cement of the concrete,it will produce voids in it,and decrease the strength.We can adjust quantity of water into concrete by this range to make

The grade of concrete is determined by its compressive strength at 28 days after pouring,measured in psi.The higher the psi rating of a given concrete mixture,the greater its strength.Most residential applications require at least 2,500 psi,according to the National.Compressive Strength of Concrete &amp; Concrete Cubes …The capacity of concrete is reported in psi pounds per sq.inch in US units and in MPa mega pascals in SI units.This is usually called as the characteristic compressive strength of concrete fc fck.For normal field applications,the concrete strength can vary from.
