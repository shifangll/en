## Ball Mills
Ball mills are commonly used for crushing and grinding the materials into an extremely fine form.The ball mill contains a hollow cylindrical shell that rotates about its axis.This cylinder is filled with balls that are made of stainless steel or rubber to the material contained in it.Rod mills,how they functionRod mills operate at lower speed than ball mills since the rods are rolled and not cascaded.For an equivalent grind,a rod mill uses less steel than a ball mill because of the lower speed and better contact between the media and ore.The rod charge must be maintained in good working condition,and broken and worn rods must be removed.
