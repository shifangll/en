## Extraction and Processing of Minerals &amp; the Environmental Impacts.
How Minerals Are Extracted From Earth.In a previous lesson,we learned about minerals,which are inorganic compounds,such as ores (like copper) and precious stones (like diamonds).The word mining sounds a lot like mineral,and that&#39;s no accident because mining is how minerals are removed from the ground.Environmental Impact Economics Metal Extraction mining …This means that metal or mineral extraction results in problems and issues in balancing ecological,environmental,economic,social advantage factors.It doesn't matter whether you are mining and processing iron ore or limestone,many of the
