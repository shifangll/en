## Compression Tests Iron Pellets
A number of compressive tests were conducted on iron ore pellets obtained from the Samarco pelletizing plant located at Ponta Ubu,Brazil.These pellets are formed by disk pelletizing of a mixture consisting of hematite iron ore,(particle size less than 50 &#181;m.PelletizingThe pelletizing of stock feed is done with the pellet mill machinery,which is done in a feed mill.Preparation of raw ingredients Feed ingredients are normally first hammered to reduce the particle size of the ingredients.Ingredients are then batched,and then.
