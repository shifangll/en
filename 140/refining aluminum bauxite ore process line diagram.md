Answer: Steps involved in the extraction of pure metals from their ores are Concentration of the ore; Extraction of the crude metal Refining of the crude metal Question 3Aluminium smeltingAluminium smelting is the process of extracting aluminium from its oxide,alumina,generally by the Hall H&#233;roult process.Alumina is extracted from the ore bauxite by means of the Bayer process at an alumina refinery.This is an electrolytic process,so an aluminium smelter uses huge amounts of electricity; smelters tend to be located close.
