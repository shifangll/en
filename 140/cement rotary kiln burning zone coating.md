## Cement kiln
Preheating Zone Kiln Inlet Zone The first reaction zone of rotary kiln system is known as the preheating zone.Here the charge gets heated up to about 800 before entering the calcining zone.Bricks in this area are prone to chemical attack from gases containing.Cement Kilns: Early rotary kilnsThe black ash cylinder was a batch process,otherwise similar.It is interesting to note that the Navarros,who first successfully used a continuous rotary kiln for portland cement,had in 1886 operated a batch process rotary furnace for burning “natural” cement.It
