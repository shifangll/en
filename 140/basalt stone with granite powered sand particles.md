## Basalt
Basalt is a major rock type that occurs in virtually every tectonic setting.Basalt is clearly the most common volcanic rock on Earth and basaltic rocks (including gabbro,diabase and their metamorphosed equivalents) are the most common rocks in the crust 2.BasaltBasalt is used in construction (e.g.as building blocks or in the groundwork),making cobblestones (from columnar basalt) and in making statues.Heating and extruding basalt yields stone wool,said to be an excellent thermal insulator.
