## What Are Jaw Crushers and How Do They Work?
28 Mar 2019 A jaw crusher is a large piece of equipment that&#39;s used in mine and ore processing plants to crush rocks.The equipment was first introducedDESIGN AND ANALYSIS OF A HORIZONTAL SHAFT IMPACT …basically of three types namely Cone crusher,Jaw crusher and Impact crusher.Our objective is to design various components of an Impact crusher like drive mechanism,shaft,rotor,hammers,casing,and discharge mechanism which will be useful in minimizing weight,cost and maximizing the capacity and also do their analysis.
