## Vertical Electrical Sounding as a Tool for Estimating,
Geophysical survey based on “Schlumberger” array of vertical electrical sounding (VES) was carried out to study the quantity of clay deposits in Delta North District,Nigeria Obviously,the quantity of clay deposit depends on its thickness Previous researchers did not work in this area primarily to search for the clay deposit The need to prospect or search for clay deposits in this area.Studies on the Five (5) Selected Clays in Abeokuta,clay deposits in Nigeria with the view to propose other possible uses such as microfiltration membranes in water treatment,food,and beverage production,chemical engineering and refractory process MATERIALS AND METHODS Raw Materials Representative samples of the five (5) different
