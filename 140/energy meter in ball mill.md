## Synthesis of Nanomaterials by High Energy Ball Milling
The impact energy of the milling balls in the normal direction attains a value of up to 40 times higher than that due to gravitational acceleration.Hence,the planetary ball mill can be used for high speeTemperature progression in a mixer ball mill SpringerLinkMechanochemistry using ball mills is a promising technique with applications in organic and inorganic chemistry as well as material sciences [1 4].During ball milling,up to 80 % of the energy that is generated in the mill is dissipated as heat [].This is why.

## Best energy consumption
Grinding energy was approximately 50 per cent of the ball mill and the drying capabilities allowed direct processing of materials of up to 20 per cent moisture content.The main energy issue was the high power consumption of mill fans,with pressure drops of 100mbar not uncommon with high nozzle ring velocities (&gt;70m s) and internal mill circulating loads of &gt;1000 per cent.Synthesis of Nanomaterials by High Energy Ball MillingThe impact energy of the milling balls in the normal direction attains a value of up to 40 times higher than that due to gravitational acceleration.Hence,the planetary ball mill can be used for high speed milling.Schematic view of motion of the ball and powder mixture.
