Graphene oxide as an additive in cement Synthesis and characterization of GO Bachelor’s Master’s thesis project Introduction Portland cement,being a major component of concrete in constructions,is a widely used material in modern society.Even though itConcreteConcrete is strong in compression,as the aggregate efficiently carries the compression load.However,it is weak in tension as the cement holding the aggregate in place can crack,allowing the structure to fail.Reinforced concrete adds either steel reinforcing bars,steel fibers,aramid fibers,carbon fibers,glass fibers,or plastic fibers to carry tensile loads.
