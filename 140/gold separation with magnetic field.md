## Magnetic field
A magnetic field is a vector field that describes the magnetic influence of electric charges in relative motion[1][2] and magnetized materials.The effects of magnetic fields are commonly seen in permanent magnets,which pull on magnetic materials (such as iron) and attract or repel other magnets.Magnetic fields surround and are created by.Magnetic separationMagnetic separation is the process of separating components of mixtures by using magnets to attract magnetic materials.The process that is used for magnetic separation detaches non magnetic material with those who are magnetic.This technique is useful for not all,but few minerals such as ferromag
