## X ray fluorescence
X ray intensity The fluorescence process is inefficient,and the secondary radiation is much weaker than the primary beam.Furthermore,the secondary radiation from lighter elements is of relatively low energy (long wavelength) and has low penetrating power,andManganese Mineral,Manganese Extraction,Manganese …Manganese mineral belongs to the weak magnetic minerals,which can be recovered by high intensity magnetic separator.Xinhai applies the magnetic process to separate manganese mineral,including two stages,rough separate the high intensity magnetic ore.
