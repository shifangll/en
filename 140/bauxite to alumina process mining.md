## Aluminum Smelting Furnaces and Processing of Bauxite Ore
The smelting of aluminum begins with the extraction of bauxite ore by a form of open cast mining.The bauxite is washed and screened before being converted to alumina,a white powdery element from which the aluminum is produced.Aluminum smelting is carried.SinterSinter Once a mainstay of the Chinese alumina industry,and alumina production in the former Soviet block countries,the sinter route takes a pyro metallurgical approach to ‘lock up’ the silica and thus prevent it from contaminating the product alumina.The process.

## Extraction Process of Aluminium from Bauxite Ore
Bauxite Mining AWAC's bauxite deposits are generally extracted by open cut mining from strata,typically some 6 metres thick under a shallow covering of topsoil and vegetation.The topsoil is removed and stored for later use in restoration of the forest.EGA's Aluminium ProductsOur bauxite is relatively high in Gibbsite and low in Bohemite,reactive silica and organic impurities.We produce both low temperature and high temperature bauxite,meaning our bauxite is able to be processed by a wide variety of alumina refineries.
