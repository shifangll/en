SGS has developed a series of testing and mineralogy assessment protocols that allow us to determine the character of refractory gold and the mass balance between refractory and free milling gold.Once the deportment or textural associations of the gold is determined and the mass balance known,flowsheet options are developed.Roasting (metallurgy)Roasting has driven off the tellurium from the original calaverite,leaving behind vesicular blebs of native gold.Roasting is a process of heating of sulphide ore to a high temperature in presence of air.It is a step of the processing of certain ores.More specifically.

## refractory ore processing
refractory ore processing AS a leading global manufacturer of crushing and milling equipment,we offer advanced,rational solutions for any size reduction requirements,including quarry,aggregate,grinding production and complete stone crushing plant.Pretreatment Process on Refractory Gold Ores with AsGold ores are considered refractory if gold extractions from a conventional cyanidation process are less than 80% even after fine grinding.1) Arsenic bearing refractory gold ore has stones extremely difficult to deal with.In the stones,gold is locked up in arsenic.
