## Suitable Starter for Ball Mill Starting Through Slipring …
&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;As I said in my earlier post that,starting toque requirement of ball mill application is high about 70 80%,so soft starters are not appropriate,as it is basically used for reducing excessive torque during starting.In ball mill the starter is required which gives sustained.Soft sensor for ball mill fill level based on uncertainty.After more work on industry scale ball mill is done,the soft sensor modeling based on the mill shell vibration for operating parameters of mill load will improve the performance of the ball mill.
