Iron ore was won by drilling and blasting ().As mining technology generally developed,so did drilling techniques and the explosives used.Smith (1990) reported that the Cleveland deposit was associated with a very strong stone roof rock (known as “dogger”) allowing mine drivages to be self supporting.However,he states that in later years where the mining had progressed to the dip,this.Iron Ore an overview ScienceDirect TopicsN.Haque,T.Norgate,in Iron Ore,2015.Abstract.Mining of iron ore is a highly capital and energy intensive process.Life cycle assessment (LCA) of the mining and mineral processing of iron ore in Australia was carried out in this chapter using SimaPro LCA software as a case study.

## Vanadium Resources in Titaniferous Magnetite Deposits
Vanadium can be recovered from titaniferous magnetite ore by either of two processes: (1) precipitating a vanadium salt from a leach of ore roasted with salt,or (2) precipitation from a leach of salt roasted vanadium rich slag obtained by smelting the ore to make a vanadium bearing pig iron…Producing Iron Ore,Phosphate Locally Leadership …Iron ore is the raw material used to make pig iron,which is one of the main raw materials used to make steel.In fact,it is on record that about 98% of the mined iron ore is used to make steel.
