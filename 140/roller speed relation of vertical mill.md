## Milling Machine Terminology Sherline Products
The Function of a Vertical Milling Machine.The milling machine is the workhorse of the machine shop.In essence,a vertical mill is like a drill press except it is fitted with sturdy bearings capable of handling side as well as end loads.Normally up to 85% of machining jobs will require a mill rather than a lathe.Operational parameters affecting the vertical roller mill.Working pressure is normalized with classifier rotor speed.Abstract.Vertical roller mills (VRM) have found applications mostly in cement grinding operations where they were used in raw meal and finish grinding stages and in power plants for coal grinding.The mill combines crushing,grinding,classification and if necessary drying operations.
