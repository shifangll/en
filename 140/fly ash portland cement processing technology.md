## Fly Ash
Conditioned solid wastes can be mixed into the lime fly ash water mixture,as described for the Portland cement S S technology above.The result is much the same,in that the target substances in the solid waste stream have become immobilized and are protected form the leaching process.Setting,rheology and packing density of biomass fly …Biomass fly ash compared to Portland cement has proportionally lower content of particles with size of tens and first single digit numbers of microns.Deficiency in this region at higher contents of biomass fly ash in cement mixtures results in deflection from ideal packing density curve.

## Fly ash
Proponents of fly ash claim that replacing Portland cement with fly ash reduces the greenhouse gas &quot;footprint&quot; of concrete,as the production of one ton of Portland cement generates approximately one ton of CO 2,compared to no CO 2 generated with fly ash.STAR&#174; Process The SEFA GroupSTAR&#174; (Staged Turbulent Air Reactor) Technology is our patented thermal beneficiation process to transform coal ash from surface impoundments or ponds into a high quality,sustainable product for the concrete industry.A long time leader in the fly ash utilization.

## Cement
Portland fly ash cement contains up to 40% fly ash under ASTM standards (ASTM C595),or 35% under EN standards (EN 1).The fly ash is pozzolanic,so that ultimate strength is maintained.Because fly ash addition allows a lower concrete water content,early strength can also be maintained.Fly AshIf we have Portland cement,and the fly ash is the pozzolana,it can be represented by silica because non crystalline silica glass is the principal constituent of fly ash.The silica combines with the calcium hydroxide released on hydration of Portland cement.Calcium.
