For an ore deposit to form,the chemical element in question must be enriched considerably versus its average crustal abundance.Hence its concentration factor in nature may be large,and put constrains on the ore processes concentrating elements in naturemining concentration oreA mineral deposit is a natural concentration of minerals in the earth's crust.The degree of concentration is called the &quot;grade&quot; of a mineral deposit.An &quot;ore deposit&quot; is a mineral deposit which has high enough grades of metal that makes it economic to mine.

## Processes that Concentrate Mineral Resources
Processes that Concentrate Mineral Resources A number of processes occur in igneous rocks to provide accumulations of otherwise rare elements or minerals.Most minerals are made up of the eight abundant elements,and most surface minerals are silicates.Mineral Ore Deposits: Meaning,Origin and Types GeologyA few non metallic minerals are often found associated with an ore mineral.These have to be separated from the ore before the same is processed for extraction of the metal.These associated minerals are called gangue minerals and are worthless.Quartz (SiO 2) is a common gangue mineral associated with many metallic ore minerals.

## Concentration of Minerals Article about Concentration of …
Concentration of minerals is performed by means of a series of consecutive operations,which constitute the enrichment program.The initial operation is crushing and pulverization of the raw material to reduce it to a particle size that is suitable for existing concentration processes and equipment,as well as for the separation of concretions and formation of particles of individual minerals.Gravity concentrationIf the ore contains an appreciable amount of sulphide minerals then,if the primary grind is finer than about 300p~m,these should be removed by froth flotation prior to gravity concentration,as they reduce the performance of spirals,tables,etc.
