## Gold Pyrite ores
Natural pH is recommended for gold flotation.Alternatively using soda ash for pH adjustment can reduce gold depression.Where gold is associated with pyrite in base metal ores where iron sulphides are depressed and report to the tailings,a separate tailings pyrite flotation concentrate should be considered.Process mineralogy of roasted pyrite and arsenopyrite …Process mineralogical techniques can provide useful information on the mineralogy and textures shown by pyrite and arsenopyrite particles that have been roasted to enhance extraction of gold from refractory gold ores.Dark field reflected light microscopy has been.
