## Apron Feeder Design
&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;Hello to all,I am quite new to bulk material handling equipment design.Now a days I am working on Apron Feeder.I have two Queries: 1.How to decide pitch of chain for a apron feeder.In otherwords how to design chain for apron feeder.2.If we have to Design a.Apron feeders: the material handling workhorsesSpecifically,the hopper shear length opening (L2) directly above the apron feeder.When applicable,this is not only a key parameter in properly sizing the apron feeder,but also the drive system as well.How does “bulk” density affect the sizing of an apron feeder?
