## Ball mill
A ball mill,a type of grinder,is a cylindrical device used in grinding (or mixing) materials like ores,chemicals,ceramic raw materials and paints.Ball mills rotate around a horizontal axis,partially filled with the material to be ground plus the grinding medium.Different materials are used as media,including ceramic balls,flint pebbles andThe operating principle of the ball mill Primo PizzaThe operating principle of the ball mill consists of following steps.In a continuously operating ball mill,feed material fed through the central hole one of the caps into the drum and moves therealong,being exposed by grinding media.The material grinding occurs during impact falling grinding balls and abrasion the particles between the balls.

## Grinding time for ball mills
For ball milling,you can assume a porosity of about 0.35 to 0.40 (the volume of space between the balls) and you can normally assume the pulp surface level is equal to the ball charge surface level.So do a crash stop and measure the volumetric filling of the charge,then multiply that volume by 0.35 or 0.40.Grinding in Ball Mills: Modeling and Process Control52 the milling process takes place during rotation as a result of the transfer of kinetic energy of the moving grinding media into the grinding product.The design of a ball mill can vary significantly depending on the size,the equipment used to load the starting material
