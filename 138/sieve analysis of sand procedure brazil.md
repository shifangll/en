## Sieve analysis
A sieve analysis (or gradation test) is a practice or procedure used (commonly used in civil engineering) to assess the particle size distribution (also called gradation) of a granular material by allowing the material to pass through a series of sieves of progressively smaller mesh size and weighing the amount of material that is stopped by each sieve as a fraction of the whole mass.TEST METHOD FOR THE GRAIN SIZE ANALYSIS OF GRANULAR …4.4 Prepare Sieve Analysis Data Sheet.Complete the heading of form SM b,&quot;Geotechnical Engineering Bureau Sieve Analysis Data&quot; (Appendix A),and be prepared to enter values from the test.If testing a granular construction item,also
