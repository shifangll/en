## Phosphate conversion coating
Phosphate coatings are used on steel parts for corrosion resistance,lubrication,or as a foundation for subsequent coatings or painting.It serves as a conversion coating in which a dilute solution of phosphoric acid and phosphate salts is applied via spraying or immersion and chemically reacts with the surface of the part being coated to form a layer of insoluble,crystalline phosphates.Zinc Plating vs.black phosphate : engineeringWith zinc plating,there's chromate treatments that act similarly to black phosphate in that it deposits an inert layer on top of the zinc,to prevent corrosion from starting.You can also paint on top of the zinc for even more corrosion protection.The tradeoff is that
