## How Does a Coal Power Plant Work?
Thermal based power plants can produce electricity from coal or other fuel sources.The coal fired process requires three different steps to turn energy released from burning coal to generating electricity for consumption.Coal fired power plants,while producing power,require a lot of water and produce a lot of pollutants like ash and CO2.What coal is used as major fuel in thermal power plant.&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;There are mainly three classifications of coal: Anthracite,Bituminous and Lignite.Lignite has the lowest grade of coal whereas anthracite is the highest one.Power plants generally use steam coal which is a grade between anthracite and bituminou.
