## What is free moisture
Fine Coal Moisture: not familiar with this term.I assume it is the Total Moisture in the fine fraction of coal.Neutrogena has a large supply of products that are completely oil free.THERMAL POWER PLANTS: COAL PULVERISING IN BOILERSWhen coal with HGI higher than 50 is fed to the pulverizer,the output will be higher than base capacity,and below 50 HGI,the output will be lower.The total moisture in coal has a high effect on mill output.The higher the moisture,the lower the output.
