21&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Uranium is a metal resource added by IC&#178; and generated as ore between layers 0 and 64,usually in groups of up to 2 blocks.It requires an iron pickaxe or better to mine.Several forms of uranium are radioactive and will poison (often quite severely) anyone handling them without the use of a Hazmat Suit.Forms.These forms of uranium are seen during ore processing:ALTERNATE MATERIALS IN AUTOMOBILE BRAKE DISC APPLICATIONS WITH EMPHASIS ON AL COMPOSITE…Journal of Engineering Research and Studies JERS Vol.I Issue I July Sept.2010 46 Review Article ALTERNATE MATERIALS IN AUTOMOBILE BRAKE DISC APPLICATIONS WITH EMPHASIS ON AL COMPOSITES A TECHNICAL REVIEW Telang A K* 1,Rehman A 2,Dixit G 3,Das S 4

## The science and technology of composite materials
15&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Humans have been using composite materials for thousands of years.Take mud bricks for example.If you try to bend a cake of dried mud,it will break easily but it is strong if you try to squash,or compress it.A piece of straw,on the other hand,has a lot of strength when you try to stretch it but almost none when you crumple it up.
