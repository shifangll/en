## Ground granulated blast furnace slag
&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;Blast furnace,a vertical shaft furnace that produces liquid metals by the reaction of a flow of air introduced under pressure into the bottom of the furnace with a mixture of metallic ore,coke,and flux fed into the top.Blast furnaces are used to produce pig iron fromCONCRETE MATERIALS AND TESTINGits relative lightness is called slag.Slag is composed of calcium oxide (CaO),silica (SiO2) and alumina (Al203).Slag is pulverized into a fine powder called ground granulated blast furnace slag and is used in this form as a cementitious component of concrete.

In the blast furnace,slag floats to the top of the iron and removed.GGBS is produced through quenching the molten slag in water and then grinding it into a fine powder.Chemically it is similar to,but less reactive than,Portland cement (Pc).What is Slag Cement? (with pictures)&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;Slag cement,often called ground granulated blast furnace slag (GGBFS),is one of the most consistent cementitious materials used in concrete.It is actually a byproduct of iron production.When the iron is processed using a blast furnace,slag and iron both collect at the bottom of the furnace.
