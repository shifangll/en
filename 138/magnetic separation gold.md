Shawn Pure gold is not magnetic.That is,it doesn't form a magnet on its own.If you put it in a magnetic field it will magnetize a tiny bit,but only so long as it's in the field.and the direction of the magnetizaqtion makes it weakly repel the magnet.There are alloys of gold,for example gold with more than about 20% of the atoms replaced by iron,which do magnetize on their own,atThe 2 basic points for understanding how magnetic separation works29 Jan 2013.After magnetic capture of the biomolecule,magnetic forces can separate it from the rest of the milieu.Because of the seeming ease of separation,biomagnetic techniques are used by some as the &#39;gold standard&#39; of separation technology.This post is about magnetic bead separation and how to validate this&nbsp;.
