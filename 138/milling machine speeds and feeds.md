## Calculation for Cutting Speed,Spindle Speed and Feed NS.
Calculation for Cutting Speed,Spindle Speed and Feed.When maximum speed of the machine spindle less than value of recommended milling conditions.When maximum speed of the machine spindle less than value of recommended milling conditions,adjust conditions by calculation as follows.Lathe machine formula Cutting speed,Depth of cut,feed.A steel shaft of 25mm diameter is turned at a cutting speed of 50 metres per minute.Find the r.p.m.of the shaft.In practice,when the calculated speed is not available in the machine the next lower value is selected.2.Feed.The feeds of the cutting tool in lathe work are the distance the tool advances for each revolution of the work.

## Milling Delrin? Speeds,feeds,coolant?
 · 1200 surface feet and don't look back using coolant on turning operations.Milling,how much spindle speed you got? Don't be a jackass about your milling cycles and let it rip.50% step over at a minimum with high feed and coolant.Seriously,don't be scared Delrin has got to be the easiest to machine plastic across the board.Calculating Feeds and Speeds CNCShopFeed rate is calculated using the following equation: Feed = N x cpt x RPM N number of cutting edges (flutes) cpt chip load (chip per tooth) is the amount of material,which should be removed by each tooth of the cutter as it rotates and advances into the work.(mm per tooth) RPM the speed at which the cutter revolves in the spindle.
