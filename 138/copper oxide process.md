## COPPER Copper production TU Delft
Flotation of non sulfide copper minerals is rare because these ores are mostly subjected to hydrometallurgical copper recovery,for example,heap leaching In Zambia and Zaire,however,siliceous copper oxide ores are floated with fatty acid collectors,and dolomitic copper oxide ores are sulfidized with sodium hydrogensulfide and then floated.Copper(I) oxide WikipediaCopper(I) oxide or cuprous oxide is the inorganic compound with the formula Cu 2 O It is one of the principal oxides of copper,the other being CuO or cupric oxide This red coloured solid is a component of some antifouling paints The compound can appear,

## Copper extraction Wikipedia
Copper processing is a complicated process that begins with mining of the ore (less than 1% copper) and ends with sheets of 9999% pure copper called cathodes,which will ultimately be made into products for everyday useThe most common types of ore,copper oxide and copper sulfide,undergo two different processes,hydrometallurgy and pyrometallurgy,respectively,due to the different.RECOVERY OF COPPER FROM OXIDE COPPER ORE BY,RECOVERY OF COPPER FROM OXIDE COPPER ORE BY FLOTATION AND LEACHING Kiraz,Emirhan MS,Department of Mining Engineering Supervisor: Prof Dr Mustafa Ümit Atalay December 2014,65 pages The aim of this study was the recovery of copper from the oxide copper ore by froth flotation and agitating sulphuric acid (H 2 SO 4) leaching
