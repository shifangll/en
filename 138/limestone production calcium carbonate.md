## What is the application of calcium carbonate in paints?
Calcium carbonate is a non toxic,odorless,non irritating white powder and one of the most versatile inorganic fillers.Calcium carbonate is neutral,substantially insoluble in water and soluble in acid.According to different calcium carbonate production methods.Limestone mbpolLimestone is not all calcium carbonate It also contains “detritus” sands and muds that are excreted by the organisms,have fallen off higher parts of the seabed,or have eroded off the land in rivers Detritus is what gives limestone its grey or brown color without it the calcium carbonate would be pure white

## What happens when acid reacts with limestone? Questions,
Limestone is mostly made up of the mineral calcium carbonate (CaCO3) This is not very soluble,so rocks don't dissolve very quickly But if you add an acid,you add hydrogen ions (H+),which will react with the carbonate to form hydrogen carbonate HCO3 ions,which are very soluble in water,and the limestone will dissolveLimestone,pH and calcium Progressive ForagePurity calcium carbonate equivalent (CCE) The purity of limestone is expressed as calcium carbonate equivalent (CCE) It is a laboratory measure of how much calcium carbonate reacts in a given sample Limestone should have a CCE of at least 90 percent Liming material CCE can range from 50 to 175 percent
