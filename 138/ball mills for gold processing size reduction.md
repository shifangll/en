## Stirred Mills Ultrafine Grinding
Figure 10.1 shows the difference in energy efficiency between a laboratory ball mill and a stirred mill grinding a gold ore using 6 mm diameter alumina balls as media.At a fine grind size there is a clear advantage in energy consumption for a stirred mill over the tumbling mill.However,as the grind size coarsens,the difference in specific energy required to achieve the grind lessens.Metso Ball Mills2017 4 21&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Ball mills designed for long life and minimum maintenance Metso overflow ball mill sizes range from 5 ft.x 8 ft.with 75 HP to 30’ x 41’.and as much as 30,000 HP.Larger ball mills are available with dual pinion or ring motor drives.Our mills incorporate many of the qualities which have made the Marcy name famous since 1913.
