## Mining Facts for Kids
Room and pillar mining often leads to retreat mining,in which supporting pillars are removed as miners retreat,allowing the room to cave in,thereby loosening more ore.Additional sub surface mining methods include hard rock mining,which is mining of hard rock (igneous,metamorphic or sedimentary) materials,bore hole mining,drift and fill mining,long hole slope mining,sub level caving.Australian Centre for Geomechanics Conference Paper: …Abstract: A stability analysis was carried out for an underground narrow vein room and pillar operation using linear elastic numerical modelling combined with a probability of failure (PoF) approach.The as mined layout was input into the model to identify areas of.

## Pennsylvania Mines
Until the maturation of modern longwall mining in the 1960s,Pennsylvania’s underground bituminous coal production came almost exclusively from room and pillar mines.Early Room and pillar mining did not include retreat mining,because they relied on manualCOALThere are two types of room and pillar mining conventional mining and continuous mining.Conventional mining is the oldest method and accounts for only about 12% of underground coal output.In conventional mining,the coal seam is cut,drilled

## Underground Mining Methods — New Pacific Metals
Room &amp; Pillar Room and pillar mining is typically chosen for flat lying (or at slightly dipping) ore bodies.Commonly used for base metal or uranium metal deposits,or bedded seams of coal potash salt,mining is done by creating openings (rooms) on a single level,leaving pillars of rock at regular intervals to support the weight of the material above (the roof).Flash (lake)historical industrial mining of rock salt was to use a Room and Pillar method (or Pillar and Stall) [8] to support the roof.[9] But when water finds its way into salt workings,it erodes the salt pillars being used to support the roof,therefore the former ceiling.
