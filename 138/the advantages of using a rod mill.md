## THE ADVANTAGES OF USING A GRINDING SYSTEM
The rod mill is a grinding system very similar to ball mills,but use steel rods instead of balls as the grinding medium.When they are being operated the ore and the rods tumble within the mill and causes a lot of friction.There is no cascading and therefore theMill (grinding)Rod mills are less common than ball mills for grinding minerals.The rods used in the mill,usually a high carbon steel,can vary in both the length and the diameter.However,the smaller the rods,the larger is the total surface area and hence,the greater the
