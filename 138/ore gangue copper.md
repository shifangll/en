## Economic,water and energy evaluation of early rejection of …
The implications of adding a dry sand fluid bed (DSFB) separator for early rejection of gangue from copper ore on the economic outcomes as well as energy and water consumed have been analysed.The analysis included capital and operating costs and considered.Gangue MineralIf the gangue mineral in an iron ore is predominantly quartz,reverse flotation is usually used in the cleaning stage to improve the concentrate grade.Figure 9.13 presents a typical flow sheet for processing an oxidized iron ore containing about 30% Fe using a combination of SLon magnetite separators and reverse flotation.

## Copper mining.From ore to copper.
The unwanted waste rock (gangue) falls to the bottom and is removed.The froth is skimmed off the surface and the enriched ore (mainly the copper mineral) is taken away for roasting.The mixture of water,foaming agent and paraffin is recycled.After this stageWhat Is Gangue?

## Innovations: Introduction to Copper: Mining &amp; Extraction
The barren rock,or gangue has to be separated from the sulfide minerals in order to smelt the metallic copper from the ore.By far the greatest proportion of copper is extracted from the sulfides of copper,iron and sometimes other metals.Such ores originate from.Copper Oxide Ore Scientific.NetAbstract: The copper oxide ore is high oxidation ratio and the high combination ratio with a low grade of Cu 0.71%.Copper concentrate of Cu 15.02% with a recovery of 38.55% was obtained by flotation.The optimum acid leaching conditions were investigated.
