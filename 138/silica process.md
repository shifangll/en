## What is silica gel and how does it work?
Silica Gel,SiO2,is essentially a synthetic,microporous form of sand.It's produced in small,irregular beads that contain thousands of microscopic cavities.These cavities create a low vapor pressure inside it,which makes the beads hygroscopic.Aqueous Colloidal Silica Manufacturing Process.Colloidal Silica manufactuirng plant.A zero effluent,low cost manufacturing process and plant capable of producing Stable Aqueous Silica Sols in various grades.THE ELECTROSOL PROCESS: This is a batch process where,Dilute Sodium silicate is dealkalised in.

## What is Silica? Eurosil
Silica deposits are normally exploited by quarrying and the material extracted may undergo considerable processing before sale.The objectives of processing are to clean the quartz grains and increase the percentage of silica present,to produce the optimum size distribution of product depending upon end use and to reduce the amount of impurities,especially iron and chromium,which colour glass.SilicaSilica fume consists of amorphous silicon dioxide.Each individual particle of silica fume is very small in the order of 1 100 th the size of a cement particle.Silica fume is also used as a filler material in refractory concretes,where its function is to improve the
