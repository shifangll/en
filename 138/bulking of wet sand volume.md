## LEARNING TECHNOLOGY: Bulking OF Aggregates
Since the volume of the saturated sand is the same as that of the dry sand,the inundated sand completely offsets the bulking effect Note down the level of the sand say,H2 Then H1 H2 shows the bulking of the sample of sand under testWhat is bulking of sand?The increase in moisture of sand increases the volume of sand.The reason is that moisture causes film of water around sand particles which results in the increase of volume of sand.For a moisture content percentage of 5 to 8 there will be an inc.

## excavation quantities and bulking factors
Example If you worked out that a drive to be excavated had a volume of 12m 3,and the soil type was clay,then you would multiply the volume by the bulking factor ie 12m 3 x 14 =168m 3 Therefore you would need to be prepared to remove 168m 3 of material which is equivalent to: 3 x 8 tonne single axle truck loads orAggregates & its Properties Shreedhar Thotapally,Since the volume of the saturated sand is the same as that of the dry sand,the inundated sand completely offsets the bulking effect Note down the level of the sand say,h2 Then h1 h2 shows the bulking of the sample of sand under test
