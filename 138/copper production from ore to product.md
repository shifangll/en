## Copper Smelting Process
Modern copper smelters use processed copper ore fed into a flash furnace,typically fired by oxygen which produces blister copper,being further processed in a converter furnace.Molten copper is poured from here into rectangular moulds,the resulting ingots subjected to electrolysis producing a metal of 99.9% purity.Copper can be recycled indefinitely without the base metal being compromised.Is Cobalt a byproduct of nickel production or copper …Both.When “making” nickel and copper,the metal has to be extracted from ores or minerals.These rocks that contain the desired metal (nickel or copper) also contain trace amounts or small amounts of cobalt.So by mining many,many tons of these.
