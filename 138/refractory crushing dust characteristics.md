## BLAST FURNACE (BF)
Blast Furnace An Introduction Blast Furnace is the focus of any integrated steel plant.Blast furnace is used to reduce the iron ore to iron.The charge,which consists of iron ore,coke and limestone etc.in the form of lumps and different ratios,is fed from the top.ChromiteChromite today is mined particularly to make stainless steel through the production of ferrochrome (FeCr),which is an iron chromium alloy.Chromite grains are commonly found in large mafic igneous intrusions such as the Bushveld in South Africa and India.
