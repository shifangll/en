## Crusher Run: The Best Uses
Crusher run can come in handy when laying down stone pavers and other masonry units.Why: Crusher run creates a firm base that will hold stone and mason pavers in place so that such pathways continue to look and function as originally intended.A layer of sand or stone dust atop of the material is recommended for extra support and stability.Impact CrusherA jaw crusher crushes only a small proportion of the original aggregate particles but an impact crusher crushes mortar and aggregate particles alike and thus generates a higher amount of fine material (O’Mahony,1990).Gyratory crushers work on the same).
