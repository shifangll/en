## Earth Science for Kids: Rocks,Rock Cycle,and Formation
The Rock Cycle Rocks are constantly changing in what is called the rock cycle.It takes millions of years for rocks to change.Here is an example of the rock cycle describing how a rock can change from igneous to sedimentary to metamorphic over time.Oil shale geology BritannicaOil shale,any sedimentary rock containing various amounts of solid organic material that yields petroleum products,along with a variety of solid by products,when subjected to pyrolysis—a treatment that consists of heating the rock to above 300 °C (about 575 °F) in the absence of oxygen.The liquid oil extracted from oil shale,once it is upgraded,creates a type of synthetic crude oil.
