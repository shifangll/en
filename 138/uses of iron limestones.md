## Limestone in industry Resources,conflicts and …
Limestone is poured into blast furnaces when iron is being extracted from iron ore.In the blast furnace,the limestone acts as a 'flux',which changes into calcium oxide and carbon dioxide.The calcium oxide reacts with the silicon dioxide in sand to form calcium.The Benefits and Effects of Limestone SciencingWater Treatment Uses For homes in rural communities,many wells have acidic water that also contain high amounts of iron or ferrous byproducts.Acidic water plays havoc with copper pipes over time,which is why many people opt for water treatment tanks that contain limestone and other sands or minerals.
