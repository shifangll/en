## Vertimill&#174;
It is also faster to install than a traditional ball mill,significantly reducing initial costs.Lower operating cost.Vertimill&#174; is an energy efficient grinding machine.They tend to grind more efficiently than for example ball mills with feeds as coarse as 6 mm to products finer than 20 microns.Cement millThe grinding action employs much greater stress on the material than in a ball mill,and is therefore more efficient.Energy consumption is typically half that of a ball mill.However,the narrowness of the particle size distribution of the cement is problematic,and the process has yet to receive wide acceptance.High pressure roll presses
