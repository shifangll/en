## Types of Iron Ore: Hematite vs.Magnetite INN
Iron ore is most often found in the forms of hematite and magnetite.Learn what makes those types of iron ore different and make an informed investment.Thanks for both comments.Mr.Newell.China backs Australia's cleaner iron ore projectThe state's ambition to export 50 million tons of magnetite by 2030 is dwarfed by the predominantly hematite ore production in neighboring Western Australia,which accounts for more than half of.
