## Grinding Mills: Ball Mill &amp; Rod Mill Design &amp; Parts
Common types of grinding mills include Ball Mills and Rod Mills.This includes all rotating mills with heavy grinding media loads.This article focuses on ball and rod mills excluding SAG and AG mills.Although their concepts are very similar,they are not discussed here.Photographs of a glass ended laboratory ball mill show action of ball mass within the mill.The action of other grinding.Grinding MillsFor the preparation of small quantities of powder many types of mill are available but,even so,the ball mill is frequently used.For the grinding of the largest quantities of material however,the ball,tube or rod mill is used almost exclusively,since these are the only types of mill which possess throughput capacity of the required magnitude.
