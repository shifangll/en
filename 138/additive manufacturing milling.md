## Hybrid Additive Manufacturing Concurrent Technologies
Hybrid manufacturing produces objects by employing both additive and subtractive technologies.Because of this dual nature,hybrid machines can begin producing a part by using either of the two processes.However,beginning production using additive manufacturing can be more efficient than milling alone and typically offers broader design freedom.OPM250L Additive Manufacturing plus CNC milling2020430&ensp&#0183&enspOPM250L Additive Manufacturing plus CNC milling combined for the first time in one machine Apr 01,2016 Sodick's new OPM250L combines metal additive manufacturing with integral linear motor drive milling,heralding a revolution in machine tool capability,particularly for
