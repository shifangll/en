## What Is Magnetic Separation? (with pictures)
&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;Magnetic separation is an industrial process where ferromagnetic contaminants are recovered from materials on the production line.Manufacturers use this to extract useful metal,separate recycling,purify materials,and perform a wide variety of other tasks.Magnetic separationCarrier magnetic separation has been proposed for more effective separation of water and solids from acid mine water to generate very pure water (Feng et al.2000).As discussed in Chapter 10,dissolved heavy metals like zinc and copper can be recovered from acid mine drainage (AMD) by selective precipitation controlling the pH for the precipitation of specific metals.
