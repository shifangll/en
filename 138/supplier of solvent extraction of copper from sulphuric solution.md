## SX Solvent Extraction of Metals: A Design Manual
Copper Recovery by Solvent Extraction A common method of copper recovery from oxide ores is dump leaching in which the excavated ore is crushed and dumped on an impervious surface in “lifts” of anything from 10 to 100 ft deep.Sulphuric acid is sprayedSELECTIVE EXTRACTION OF COBALT FROM NICKEL SULPHATE …sulphide sludge.The solvent extraction of cobalt from the solution was effected using Cyanex 272,a commercial product of the firm Cytec Inc.which is a derivative of di,4,4 methylphenyl phosphine acid.Kerosene was used as organic solvent.
