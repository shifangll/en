## Determining Rock Mass Bearing Capacity and Strength
A final foundation design is controlled by considerations such as settlement,stability from sliding and overturning rather than by bearing capacity.However it is still makes sense for a designer to evaluate the rock mass strength bearing capacity to ensure that the.RockRock Rock Thermal properties: Heat flow (or flux),q,in the Earth’s crust or in rock as a building material,is the product of the temperature gradient (change in temperature per unit distance) and the material’s thermal conductivity (k,the heat flow across a surface.
