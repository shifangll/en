## Concrete Mix Design Calculations
1 22 2014 2 3 Water,Cement,&amp; Aggregate • As the water to cement ratio increases,the strength of a concrete mix decreases.concrete mix decreases.• As the surface area of the aggregate increases the more water will be needed to maintain a given slump.What is the concrete mixing ratio in m30 concreteAbove answer is not as per engineering standards.For concrete mixing ration in M30 grade concrete,the mix has to be designed after testing all the materials including water in labs.

## What is the mix ratio of M30 concrete?
M30 stands for the mix of concrete which after 28 days of curing will give the strength of 30 N mm&#178;.At my site for building construction grade M30 is being used.Ratio of the ingredients are following for M30 concrete mix ( In Liter ) : CEMENT .Concrete Slump Test Procedure,Applications &amp; Types of …A slump test is a method used to determine the consistency of concrete.The consistency,or stiffness,indicates how much water has been used in the mix.The stiffness of the concrete mix should be matched to the requirements for the finished product quality.
