## Tin processing
Tin processing Tin processing Mining and concentrating: Vein deposits,such as those in Bolivia and the United Kingdom,usually occur in granite formations and are recovered by conventional underground hard rock mining techniques.In deep mines,primary crushing equipment is usually located underground in order to reduce the ore to a manageable size before transportation to the surface.Tin miningHowever,the tin concentrate grade of 40% is required,meaning the enrichment of hundreds or thousands times.Targeting at the refractory tin ore,low grade tin concentrate is obtained and it has to be further extracted by special metallurgy process.

## Extraction of Tin Stannum Tin
Extraction of tin consists of three parts,i.e.tin ore concentration,smelting and refining.Cassiterite is the main source of tin ore,with specific gravity of 6.7g cm 3,density larger than most of gangue.Therefore,90% of tin concentrate is mainly obtained from cassiterite.Tin ore separation processThe density of tin ore is bigger than paragenetic mineral,so we use gravity concentration to processing tin ore.Because there are many oxide iron ore inside,for example : magnetite,hematite,if use gravity concentration or flotation,that could not separate them.
