## Minerals and Rocks
Minerals and rocks are the essential building blocks of the geosphere.Although there are over 3,000 species of minerals,only a few of them,such as quartz,feldspar,mica,amphibole,pyroxene,olivine and calcite,occur commonly as rock forming minerals.University of Minnesota’s Mineral Pages: Potassium FeldsparFeldspar is called a rock forming mineral,very common,and usually makes up a large part of the rock.In sum,any glassy mineral that's slightly softer than quartz is very likely considered a feldspar.
