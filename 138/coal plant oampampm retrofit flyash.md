## A review on the utilization of fly ash
In this paper,the utilization of fly ash in construction,as a low cost adsorbent for the removal of organic compounds,flue gas and metals,light weight aggregate,mine back fill,road sub base,and zeolite synthesis is discussed.Fly ashFly ash material solidifies while suspended in the exhaust gases and is collected by electrostatic precipitators or filter bags.Since the particles solidify rapidly while suspended in the exhaust gases,fly ash particles are generally spherical in shape and range in size from 0.5 &#181;m to 300 &#181;m.The major consequence of the rapid cooling is.
