## Rock Thin Sections (Petrographic Thin Section Preparation) …
In optical mineralogy and petrography,a thin section is a laboratory preparation of a rock,mineral,soil,pottery,bones,even metal sample for use with a polarizing petrographic microscope,electron microscope and electron microprobe.A thin sliver of rock is cut.Grinding Ball DesignGrinding balls are essential mechanical components in ball and semiautogenous (SAG) mills.Their function is crushing and grinding ore rocks weighing up to 45 kg (100 lb) preparatory to recovery of valuable minerals,from lead through rare earth elements,which are.

## What is Heat Treatment? Hardening,Tempering,…
Normalizing involves heating steel,and then keeping it at that temperature for a period of time,and then cooling it in air.The resulting microstructure is a mixture of ferrite and cementite which has a higher strength and hardness,but lower ductility.DoITPoMSEtching is used to reveal the microstructure of the metal through selective chemical attack.It also removes the thin,highly deformed layer introduced during grinding and polishing.In alloys with more than one phase,etching creates contrast between different
