## Umetal
Hematite is one of the most abundant minerals on Earth's surface and in the shallow crust.It is an iron oxide with a chemical composition of Fe2O3.Concentrates Iron ore concentrates are deep beneficiated iron ore products,used for sintering and blast furnace.Iron (Fe) and waterThe iron cycle means reduction of tertiary iron by organic ligands (a process that is photo catalysed in surface waters),and oxidation of binary iron.Iron forms chelation complexes that often play an important role in nature,such as haemoglobin,a red colouring agent in blood that binds and releases oxygen in breathing processes.

## Iron ore (fines)
Iron ore is the raw material used to make Pig Iron,which is one of the main raw materials to make steel.98% of the mined iron ore is used to make steel.Indeed,it has been argued that iron ore is &quot;more integral to the global economy than any other commodityIron ore extraction techniquesIron ore reserves are normally found within a few meters from the ground surface,and most of the major mines of the world are operating an opencut system,which requires little sophistication,except in terms of the equipment used and the quantities needed to be.
