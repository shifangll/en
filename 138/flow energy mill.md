## Analysis of Fluid Energy Mill by gas solid two phase flow.
&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;Basically,the size reduction in the Fluid Energy Mill is achieved by intensive particulate collisions inside the gas solid two phase flow.This study only focuses on the two phase flow inside the FEM and the particle breakage process is beyond the scope.Wind Energy BasicsWind Energy and Wind Power.Wind is a form of solar energy.Winds are caused by the uneven heating of the atmosphere by the sun,the irregularities of the earth's surface,and rotation of the earth.Wind flow patterns are modified by the earth's terrain,bodies of water,and vegetative cover.
