## Autogeneous Grinding VS Steel Grinding Media in Flotation
In grinding,the use of steel media in a rod ball mill circuit clearly diminishes the subsequent froth flotation performance over purely autogenous grinding.The use of recycle water in grinding also clearly diminishes the subsequent froth flotation performance associated with fresh tap water.Some of these flotation deficiencies are recoverable by using stronger collectors at higher dosages.Semi Autogenous Mill Cement Production Line,Cement …Semi Autogenous Mill Description of Semi Autogenous Mill: This semi autogenous mill,also called semi autogenous grinding mill or SAG mill,is mainly used to grind ores and other particulate matter in different fields,like chemical industry,mining field,metallurgy
