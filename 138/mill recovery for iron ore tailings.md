## Tailings
Tailings are the materials left over after the process of separating the valuable fraction from the uneconomic fraction of an ore.Tailings are distinct from overburden,which is the waste rock or other material that overlies an ore or mineral body and is displaced during mining without being processed.US3337328A Iron ore beneficiation process Google PatentsUS3337328A US376338A US37633864A US3337328A US 3337328 A US3337328 A US 3337328A US 376338 A US376338 A US 376338A US 37633864 A US37633864 A US 37633864A US 3337328 A US3337328 A US 3337328A Authority US United States Prior art keywords concentrate iron separation ore silica Prior art date 1964 06 19 Legal status (The legal status is an assumption and is not a legal,
