## THE OPTIMAL BALL DIAMETER IN A MILL
grinding quartz and copper ore in a laboratory ball mill,there has been defined a general form of the equation for determining: the optimal ball diameter depending on the grain size being ground; and the parameter of the equation through which the influence of a mill is beingVertimill&#174;It is capable of handling feed sizes up to 6 mm and grinding to products less than 20 microns,and has standard mill sizes ranging from 15HP (11kW) to 4500HP (3352 kW).Support from Metso experts.Metso draws from more than 100 years of mill design and manufacturing expertise,and over three decades of successful Vertimill&#174; applications.

## Ball Mills vs Rod Mills
When the mill is rotated without feed or with very fine feed,the rods are in parallel alignment and in contact with one another for their full length.New feed entering at one end of the mill causes the rod charge to spread at that end.This produces a series of wedge shaped slots tapering toward the discharge end.The tumbling and rolling rods expend most of their crushing force on the.Cement Ball MillCement ball mill mainly consists of feed port,bearing outer gland,bearing,bearing gland,bearing inner gland,feed grinding head,slate,small lining,large lining,cylinder,flower board,big gear,out The material is composed of a material inlet,a bearing base,a grinding end grinding head and a bracket.

## Energy efficiency
The use of tower mills as an energy efficient alternative to secondary and regrind ball milling became a common inclusion in the latter part of the previous century.Traditionally the higher energy efficiency was attributed to the difference between attrition grinding in tower mills and impact grinding in ball milling.The Overflow ball Mill Integrity comes to the firstWorking Principle Overflow ball mill is used in concentrator.The discharging is due to the fact that the hollow axis diameter of discharging end is slightly larger than that of feeding end,resulting in a
