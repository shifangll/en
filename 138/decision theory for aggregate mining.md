## A Microeconomic View of Data Mining
programming,and game theory; we feel that they suggest some of the ﬁrst steps in a research agenda aimed at assessing quantitatively the utility of data mining operations.3We use “aggregate” in its microeconomics usage — summary of a parameter over aBootstrap aggregatingBootstrap aggregating,also called bagging (from bootstrap aggregating),is a machine learning ensemble meta algorithm designed to improve the stability and accuracy of machine learning algorithms used in statistical classification and regression.It also reduces variance and helps to avoid overfitting.Although it is usually applied to.
