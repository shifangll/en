## Ball Mill Finish Calculator
Ball Mill Finish Calculator Martin Chick &amp; AssociatesBall Mill Finish CalculatorThe Ball Mill Finish Calculator can be used when an end mill with a full radius (a ball mill) is used on a contoured surface.The tool radius on each side of the cut will leave stock referred to as a scallop.The finish of the part will be determined by the height of the scallop,amd the scallop will be.The Anatomy of an End Mill&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;The profile refers to the shape of the cutting end of the tool.It is typically one of three options: square,corner radius,and ball.Square Profile.Square profile tooling features flutes with sharp corners that are squared off at a 90&#176; angle.Corner Radius.This type of tooling breaks up a sharp corner with a radius form.

## Milling cutter
Ball cutter Ball nose cutters or ball end mills (lower row in image) are similar to slot drills,but the end of the cutters are hemispherical.They are ideal for machining dimensional contoured shapes in machining centres,for example in moulds and dies.Page 1 Ball Milling TheoryThe speed at which the ball mill jar rotates is responsible for maintaining the slope of the cascading media pile,which is known in the industry as the &quot;angle of break.&quot; This angle can be between 40 to 65 degrees as measured from the horizontal.If the angle is too shallow,the media will not cascade much from one end to the other.
