While LiCoO 2 electrodes insert lithium reversibly in any polar aprotic Li salt solution of sufficient anodic stability,the process of Li insertion of graphitic carbon,as well as the stability of graphite electrodes in Li salt solutions,is highly dependent on the.Brine Vs.Conductivity SciencingBrine Vs.Conductivity.Conductivity is a measure of a material's ability to carry an electrical current.Conductivity can also be measured for substances such as saline water,or water with significant salt content.Brine is water that is heavily saturated with inorganic.
