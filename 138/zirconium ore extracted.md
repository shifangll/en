## Zirconium
Zirconium is used for the fabrication of fuel cladding tubes for existing nuclear reactors (PWR,pressurized water reactor).The two major ore minerals (zircon and zirconium silicate) treated of the production of zirconium metal contain from 0.5 to several percent8].how is silin extracted from sandhow is silicon extracted from sand How is Silicon extracted from Sand answers.ndustrially,silica is converted to pure silicon by heating it with coke (the form of coal,not the drink) in a furnace But there's an even easier,if less cost effective,method that I learned.
