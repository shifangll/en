## Blast Furnace
This gas is used for the furnace mills,in gas engines and for electricity and steam generation.Often,in the steel industry,blast furnace gas is used as an accessional to natural gas (Bojic and Mourdoukountas,2000).Blast furnace gas deposits adhere firmly; therefore,boilers using these type of fuel should be frequently cleaned.Steel making today and tomorrowThere are major differences between the steel making process of today and the HYBRIT process of tomorrow.In the current blast furnace based process,coal is the main source of energy.The use of coke ovens produces metallurgical coke and coke oven gas.The.

&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;Blast furnace,a vertical shaft furnace that produces liquid metals by the reaction of a flow of air introduced under pressure into the bottom of the furnace with a mixture of metallic ore,coke,and flux fed into the top.Blast furnaces are used to produce pig iron fromSteel millA major environmental hazard associated with integrated steel mills is the pollution produced in the manufacture of coke,which is an essential intermediate product in the reduction of iron ore in a blast furnace.Integrated mills may also adopt some of the processes used in mini mills,such as arc furnaces and direc
