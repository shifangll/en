## Immersion Mill Using Circulation Milling Technology
&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;Hockmeyer’s immersion mill makes use of circulation milling technology.This technology is the same concept used in the new high circulation horizontal mills.This allows for rapid pumping of slurry through the media field several more times and is highly effective when compared to any other mill,including vertical or horizontal mills.Milling Machines vs.Lathe MachinesWhile lathe machines are more limited in use than a milling machine,they are superior for cylindrical parts.While a mill can make the same cuts that a lathe does,it …
