## Metal toxicity
Metal toxicity or metal poisoning is the toxic effect of certain metals in certain forms and doses on life.Some metals are toxic when they form poisonous soluble compounds.Certain metals have no biological role,i.e.are not essential minerals,or are toxic when in a.Beryllium poisoningBeryllium poisoning is poisoning by the toxic effects of beryllium,or more usually its compounds.It takes two forms: Acute beryllium poisoning,usually as a result of exposure to soluble beryllium salts Chronic beryllium disease (CBD) or berylliosis,usually as a result of long term exposure to beryllium oxide usually caused by inhalation.
