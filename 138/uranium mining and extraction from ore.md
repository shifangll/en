## Uranium: How is it Mined?
Uranium resources can be extracted from the ground in three ways: open pit,underground,and in situ leach (ISL).Open Pit Mining Open pit mining,also known as strip mining,is the removal of surficial soils and uneconomic rock to get at the ore belowWyoming State Geological SurveyOrebodies lying less than about 500 feet below the surface are typically surface mined as it is much cheaper than underground mining.After extraction,the uranium ore is transported to a processing plant where it is milled.This process involves crushing the ore

## Uranium Mining,Processing,and Reclamation
This chapter outlines the basic steps involved in mining,processing,and reclamation that might be suitable for uranium ore deposits in the Commonwealth of Virginia.For uranium ore deposits,the choice of mining methods and processing options is very deposit specific and dependent on many variables such as the quality and quantity of the ore,the shape and depth of the ore deposit,site.The 10 biggest uranium mines in the worldThe Kraznokamensk uranium mining operation consists of six operational underground mines namely Mine 1,Mine 2,Gluboky Mine,Shakhta 6R,Mine 6 and Mine 8.Uranium production at Kraznokamensk started in 1968.The ore body at Kraznokamensk is

## Uranium processing
Uranium processing Uranium processing Leaching: Roasted uranium ores are leached of their uranium values by both acidic and alkaline aqueous solutions.For the successful operation of all leaching systems,uranium must either be initially present in the more stable hexavalent state or be oxidized to that state in the leaching process.Acid leaching is commonly performed by agitating an ore.Uranium Extraction ProcessUranium Ore assaying approximately 0.25% U3O8,slightly under 1% V205 and 6.5% CaCO3 is received at the mill from company owned and operated mines and from custom ore suppliers.Virtually all of the production from the company mines is carnotite.
