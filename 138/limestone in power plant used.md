## FLUE GAS DESULPHURIZATION
GD systems are installed in power plants to remove SO 2 from flue gas 9 (see Figure 1: Schematics of a wet FGD system)10 Flue gas is sprayed with a reagent (wet limestone is commonly used),which reacts with the SO 2 in the flue gas producing calcium sulphate di hydrate [CaSO 4 •2H 2 O],also known as gypsum The process limits the amount of.Limestone Mining Use In MachineryLimestone mining equipment is used in limestone quarrying plant to mine limestone in usa china indonesia malaysia philippines india uganda saudi ghana get price and support online equipment used in limestone mining prestigeinterio equipment used in limes.

## A simple model to help understand water use at power,
The power plant’s net efficiency is simply the heat content of electricity (3600 kJ kWh) divided by the heat rate (kJ kWh) (see Equation 2) (2) The power plant’s heat rate depends on the fuel type used and the specific power plant design All the heat put into the plant that is not converted into electricity has to be dissipated somehow to theHow does limestone in a power station release carbon …When heated past a certain point,limestone (calcium carbonate) decomposes into quicklime (calcium oxide) and carbon dioxide.I don't know what &quot;a power station&quot; has to do with.
