## Fineness of Cement
Finer cement offers a greater surface area for hydration and hence faster the development of strength.The fineness of grinding has increased over the years.But now it has got nearly stabilized.Different cements are ground to different fineness.CLINKER GRINDING IN CEMENT PRODUCTIONEarlier we considered a mixture of which materials is used in cement production.The base of this mixture is a clinker.In this article,we will consider the composition of clinker and its impact on grinding balls deterioration in milling process.Clinker (in cement.
