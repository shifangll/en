## Analysis of ball mill grinding operation using mill power.
Thus,a small ball load and a low mill speed are preferable from the point of view of variation in the specific energy consumption with particle load.However,in doing so one has to take in to account the mill production rate also.Reasonably high levels ofBall Mill Grinding TheoryThe proper operating speeds of ball mills vary inversely as the square root of the diameters.The proper operating speed of a ball mill increases as the size of the ball load increases.Due to interference between the balls,the volume of the charge should not be over 60 per cent,of the volume of the mill.
