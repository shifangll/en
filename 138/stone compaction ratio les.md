## Proctor compaction test
The Proctor compaction test is a laboratory method of experimentally determining the optimal moisture content at which a given soil type will become most dense and achieve its maximum dry density.The test is named in honor of Ralph Roscoe Proctor [],who in 1933 showed that the dry density of a soil for a given compactive effort depends on the amount of water the soil contains during soil.Soil Compaction HandbookSOIL COMPACTION HANDBOOK 7 Effect of moisture The response of soil to moisture is very important,as the soil must carry the load year round.Rain,for example,may transform soil into a plastic state or even into a liquid.In this state,soil has very little or no
