## How concrete is made
Concrete is a hardened building material created by combining a chemically inert mineral aggregate (usually sand,gravel,or crushed stone),a binder (natural or synthetic cement),chemical additives,and water.Although people commonly use the word.VSI Sand Making Machine,Sand Making Equipment,Sand …The VSI sand making machine is specially designed for highway,hydroelectric dam construction,high rise buildings,municipal,concrete mixing stations to provide quality sand and gravel aggregate,is the preferred equipment in the artificial sand field.

## How Does a Sandblaster Work?
All sandblasters work on roughly the same principles: finely ground silica sand is used to clean and abrade a surface,typically metal,of any rust,paint or other unwanted surface materials.This is done by means of an air powered pressure gun that fires out the sand.REINFORCED CONCRETE FRAME CONSTRUCTIONReinforced Concrete Frame Construction 3 of the key features required for desirable seismic behavior of building structures.It can be defined as the ability of a material to stretch (deform) significantly before failure.Steel (and some other metals) exhibit ductile
