## Development of size reduction equations for calculating.
The wood chips were successively ground in a hammer mill using screen sizes of 25.4 mm,10 mm,6.4 mm,and 3.2 mm.The input power and the flow of material into the grinder were recorded continuously.The recorded power input vs.mean particle size showed that the Rittinger equation had the best fit to the experimental data.The ground particle.Hammer Mills PraterOur Hammer Mills are commonly used for many different particle reduction applications,including those that require high capacities,extreme power efficiency and uniform particle size.With a Prater hammer mill,you can increase the mill’s throughput capacity without having to increase its power requirements.
