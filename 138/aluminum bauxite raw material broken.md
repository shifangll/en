## Aluminum bauxite raw material broken
Aluminum Once separated out,the pure aluminum is cast into blocks known as ingots,which can be worked or shaped or used as a raw material for making aluminum alloys.Making usable,shiny aluminum from rocky lumps of bauxite that you've dug from theAluminumAluminum reacts so readily with oxygen that you never naturally find it in its pure form.Instead,compounds of aluminum exist in huge quantities in Earth's crust as an ore (raw rocky material) called bauxite.

## Aluminium
Aluminium is the world&#161;&#175;s most abundant metal.The versatility of aluminium makes it the most widely used metal after steel.The specifications,properties,classifications and class details are provided for aluminium and aluminium alloys.Bauxite: The principal ore of aluminum.Almost all of the aluminum that has ever been produced has been made from bauxite.Many people are surprised to learn that bauxite is a rock and not a mineral.Physical Properties of Bauxite Bauxite is typically a soft material with a hardness of only 1 to 3 on the Mohs scale.

## Aluminum life cycle
Aluminum production starts with the raw material bauxite,which contains 25 percent aluminum and is mostly found in a belt around the equator.There are around 29 billion tonnes of known reserves of bauxite and at the current rate of extraction,these reserves will last us more than 100 years.BauxiteBauxite is a sedimentary rock with a relatively high aluminium content.It is the world's main source of aluminium and gallium.Bauxite consists mostly of the aluminium minerals gibbsite (Al(OH)3),boehmite (γ AlO(OH)) and diaspore (α AlO(OH)),mixed with the two iron oxides goethite (FeO(OH)) and haematite (Fe2O3),the aluminium clay.
