Copper Mining and Processing: Processing of Copper.Copper processing is a complicated process that begins with mining of the ore (less than 1% copper) and ends with sheets of 99.99% pure copper called cathodes,which will ultimately be made into products for everyday use.The most common types of ore,copper oxide and copper sulfide,undergo.Copper ore processingCopper ore processing: The copper ore beneficiation production line generally adopts a relatively simple process.After a period of grinding,the fineness 200 mesh accounts for about 50% to 70%,1 rough selection,2~3 selections,1~2 sweeps.If the particle size of the copper mineral is relatively fine,a stage grinding process may be considered.
