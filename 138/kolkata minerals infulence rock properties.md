## granite Composition,Properties,Types,&amp; Uses Britannica
Granite,coarse or medium grained intrusive igneous rock that is rich in quartz and feldspar; it is the most common plutonic rock of the Earth’s crust,forming by the cooling of magma (silicate melt) at depth.Learn more about the properties and uses of granite in thisProperties of Minerals Earth Science VisionlearningIdentifying minerals by physical properties The most common minerals in Earth's crust can often be identified in the field using basic physical properties such as color,shape,and hardness.The context of a mineral is important,too some minerals can form under the same conditions,so you are likely to find them in the same rock,while others form under very different conditions and will.

## 3 Aggregate Properties
INDOT uses an elemental magnesium (Mg) content test to determine if a rock source is dolomitic.An elemental magne sium content of 10.3 percent or above is required for dolomite aggregates.Some aggregates have minerals that are subject to oxidationCompressive strength of rocksMechanical failure in rocks generally means either fracturing or permanent deformation as a result of compression.While many methods for calculating failure relationships exist,an initial measure of the compressive strength of reservoir rocks is still needed for use in those calculations.

## 6 Characteristics For Rocks and Minerals
There are 6 types of characteristics for rocks and minerals.They are a Hardness (is a measure of the mineral's resistance to being scratched,The Mohs Hardness scale is how we measure the hardness,for example : 1= Softest 10= Hardest ) Lustre ( some minerals are shiny and some are dull,lustre means metallic or non metallic.MagnetiteMagnetite is a rock mineral and one of the main iron ores,with the chemical formula Fe 3 O 4.It is one of the oxides of iron,and is ferrimagnetic; it is attracted to a magnet and can be magnetized to become a permanent magnet itself.It is the most magnetic of all the naturally occurring minerals on Earth.
