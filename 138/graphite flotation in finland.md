Introduction SF flotation cell is a mechanical agitation type flotation equipment with self slurry suction and self air suction Effective Volume 0.37～20m 3 Product Improvement Both sides of the impeller with back rake blades ensures double circulating of slurry insideFroth Flotation PrinciplesGraphite Flotation Graphite is perhaps one of the easiest non metallic minerals to recover by flotation because of its natural flotability and water repellent action.It has been successfully floated as coarse as 10 mesh,which contributes much to the market value.
