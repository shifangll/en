## Ball Mill
The ball mill is a tumbling mill that uses steel balls as the grinding media.The length of the cylindrical shell is usually 1 1.5 times the shell diameter (Figure 8.11).The feed can be dry,with less than 3% moisture to minimize ball coating,or slurry containing 20 40%.Chapter 18.Feed Milling Processes(d) The amount of steam added to a given volume of feed should be in balance such that the drive motor on the pellet mill is operating at its maximum amperage.The opening of the steam valve at the pellet mill has a direct relation to the amount of water entering
