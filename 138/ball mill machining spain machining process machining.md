## 10 Tips for Titanium : Modern Machine Shop
 · High feed mills—a tool concept developed for machining tool steels in the die mold industry—have been adapted in recent years to machining titanium.A high feed mill requires a light axial depth of cut,but when run at this light depth,the tool permits feed rates higher than milling cutters with more conventional designs.Correlation between process parameters and milling efficiencyCorrelation between process parameters and milling efficiency Anna Johansson An experimental ball milling study was performed to compare the deagglomeration behavior and the evolution of the particle size distribution with increasing milling time of two relatively coarse WC powders used for the production of cemented carbide cutting tools.
