## Albion process
The Albion process is an atmospheric leaching process for processing zinc concentrate,refractory copper and refractory gold.The process is important because it is the most cost effective method currently in use for extracting both the zinc and lead from concentrates that contain high lead levels (7% or …process of gold agitation leaching method high frequencyGold Agitation Cyanidation Leaching Agitation leaching is suitable for process materials having a finer particle size,i.e.less than 0.3 mm.The advantages of this method are: high leaching speed,large processing capacity,mechanized operation,and high gold.

## Leaching (chemistry)
Leaching processes There are many types of leaching scenarios,therefore the extent of this topic is vast.In general however,the three substances can be looked at as a carrier,substance A,a solute,substance B,and a solvent,substance C.Substance A and B are somewhat homogenous in a system prior to the introduction of substance C.At the beginning of the leaching process,substance C.Cyanide ProcessCyanide is the process of extracting gold or silver from the ores by dissolving in a dilute solution of potassium cyanide or sodium cyanide.Learn more about Cyanidation of Gold along with formula Cyanide process is also called as Macarthur forest Process.It is the.
