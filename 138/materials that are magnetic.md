A small magnetic field is created around the conductor with the direction of this magnetic field with regards to its “North” and “South” poles being determined by the direction of the current flowing through the conductor.Magnetism plays an important role in Electrical and Electronic Engineering because without it components such as relays,solenoids,inductors,chokes,coils.Magnetic Shielding Materialscan use the magnetic shielding materials listed below to make your own hinged shield.If you want an easier solution,here it is.It's a picture (or poster) in a nice frame,with high performance Giron shielding material behind the picture.Just put a nail The.

## What Materials Shield Magnets? Sciencing
Because of this,the materials used for magnetic shielding have to be able to sustain a strong magnetic field; that is to say,they have to have a high magnetic permeability.Besides common materials such as iron,nickel and cobalt,there are several proprietary alloys commercially available that are especially designed for use as magnetic shields.What is magnetic material? What are two examples?Magnetic materials are those materials that can be either attracted or repelled when placed in an external magnetic field and can be magnetized themselves When a unpaired electrons move in a space in material they will be produce some field around.
