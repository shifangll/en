## Metal Accounting Centre for Minerals Research
Metal accounting is the estimation of (saleable) metal in a mine and subsequent process streams over a defined time period.Comparisons of estimates,from different sources over a specific time period,are called reconciliation.Metal accounting research isDesigning for metal accounting2011 6 28&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;for Metal Accounting which is being developed as a deliverable of the AMIRA International project P754 Improving Metal Accounting.The P754 project had its origins in a workshop,Challenges in Metal Accounting and Information Management,held in Cape Town in August 2001,and is sponsored by five major mining companies.
