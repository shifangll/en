## Cyanide free gold recovery
The infrastructure for a processing plant that uses cyanidation typically costs $30 million,and is therefore,a barrier to entry for gold miners with smaller deposits that do not fit into the large scale economies of gold production.Gold recovery by cyanidation is also of.GoldGold in Paramarginal and Submarginal Resources has declined by about 1100 tonnes since 2009.Australia's Inferred Mineral Resources of gold rose marginally by 58 tonnes to 4571 tonnes in 2012 and account for 30 % of gold in all JORC Code categories.
