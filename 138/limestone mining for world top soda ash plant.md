## Lime in the Production of Soda Ash Graymont
One of the major sources of soda ash (Na2 CO3) and caustic soda (NaOH) in North America involves the refining of naturally occurring trona ores.These ores are mixtures of carbonates,bicarbonates and impurities that must be refined to produce marketable.The Role of the Calciner in Producing Soda AshSoda ash,or sodium carbonate (Na 2 CO 3),is a versatile alkali material,critical in the production of a litany of products and materials.From detergents and chemicals,to consumer products and water softeners,this material can be found in many of the products we interact with throughout our daily lives.
