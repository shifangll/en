## winning of metal apply to metal ore
&#183; Aluminum is the most abundant metal element in the earth's crust,but it is always found in a compound rather than an easily refined ore.Alum is one such compound.Scientists tried to tease the metal out of alum,but the process was costly until Charles Martin Hall patented an inexpensive method to produce aluminum in 1889.crude metalA number of activities covered by those regulations do not have applicable thresholds,indicating that all facilities undertaking such activities (including the refining of mineral oil and gas,the roasting or sintering of metal ore and the production of non ferrous crude metals from ore,concentrates or secondary raw materials) are regulated.
