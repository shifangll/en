## Enhancing the capacity of large
Too large a material ball ratio indicates too much ore in the mill,which might cause the mill to swell,and would affect the movement of grinding media and the circulation of ore in the mill,and also lower the mill capacity.With a filling rate of 32% and a material ball ratio of 0.7,0.85,1.0,and 1.15,the effect of the material ball.The Average Cost of a Wind Turbine BizfluentWhile there is no available &quot;average cost&quot; of a wind turbine,there is,at least for large turbines,an average cost per megawatt.In 2015,it was about $2 million per megawatt.The SeaTitan 10MW,therefore,although not priced at the time,could cost in the neighborhood of $20 million.
