## How do you mine coal
Coal is mined by two methods: surface or 'opencast' mining or underground or 'deep' mining.The choice of mining method largely depends on the geology of the coal deposit.Surface Mining Methods and Equipmentin surface and underground mines.However,the total number of injuries per one million employee hours for underground US coal mines in the last decade is three to four times higher than for surface mines.The difference between the injury rates per one million

## Coal mining
Coal mining Coal mining Underground mining: In underground coal mining,the working environment is completely enclosed by the geologic medium,which consists of the coal seam and the overlying and underlying strata.Access to the coal seam is gained by suitable openings from the surface,and a network of roadways driven in the seam then facilitates the installation of service …Coal mining World Coal AssociationSurface mining is only economic when the coal seam is near the surface.This method recovers a higher proportion of the coal deposit than underground mining as all coal seams are exploited 90% or more of the coal can be recovered.Large opencast mines can.
