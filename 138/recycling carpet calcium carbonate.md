## Transgressive Recycling Produces Organic Rich Carbonate Muds
ABSTRACT.Typical carbonate muds in the coastal bays of south Florida contain 10% particulate organics.Carbonate muds formed in response to historical and Holocene transgressive recycling contain 40% organics.Historical recycling is in response to aUS20090300982A1The calcium carbonate component of waste carpet is concentrated by mechanical means and or chemical means then subjected to a heat treatment at a temperature below the decomposition temperature of calcium carbonate to volatilize or modify organic.
