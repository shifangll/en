## What is the hardness of andesite rock Answers
"Andesite" is a rock type not a mineral (it is made of a mixture of minerals) Mohs scale relates the hardness of individual MINERALS not ROCK TYPES and thus your question can,not be answered AnsweredZircon record of the plutonic volcanic connection,realms in the upper crust,(2) a protracted time scale for constructing an intermediate mush large enough to hold 500 km3 of rhyolite,and (3) the prolonged extraction of that melt prior to eruption,monzonite dacite porphyry are separated by a compositional gap (~10 wt% SiO 2); only a few samples fall within that gap and show textural.
