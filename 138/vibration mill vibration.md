## Spindle Vibration
This document contains the Displacement and Velocity vibration tolerances for mill spindles.Refer to the following procedures for how to run a vibration analysis test: Vibration Analysis RS 232 Interface; VibratioVibration Instability in Rolling Mills: Modeling and.In particular,a stability criterion for the critical rolling speed is used to predict the maximum rolling speed without chatter instability on schedules from a 5 stand tandem mill rolling thin steel product.The results correlate well with measurements of critical speed occurring on the mill using a vibration monitor.
