## Bond Work Index
The ability to simulate the Bond work index test also allows examination of truncated ball mill feed size distributions on the work index.For grinding circuits where the feed to a ball mill is sent directly to the classifier and the cyclone underflow feeds the ball mill (see Figure 3.10),a question arises as to whether this practice will alter the ball mill work index (BW i) of the material.Mill (grinding)W is the work index measured in a laboratory ball mill (kilowatt hours per metric or short ton) P 80 is the mill circuit product size in micrometers F 80 is the mill circuit feed size in micrometers.Rod mill A rotating drum causes friction and attrition between steel
