## Copper Nickel Alloy: The Definitive Guide
45 Copper Nickel This alloy consists of 55% and 45 % copper and nickel respectively.One of its outstanding property is that it has great resistance to the low temperature coefficient.It also has ideal electrical resistivity.In fact,it is this particular aspect thatAn alloy consists of copper,zinc,and tin in the ratio 2:3:5.…By 2:3:5 ratio still implies a lot of things.Is it mass ratio or mole ratio.However since it is mostly about alloy,I think it closely implies mass ratio.If that’s the case,then it comes to a simple mathematic.We can find mass fraction of eac.
