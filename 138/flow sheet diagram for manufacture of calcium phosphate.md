Phosphoric acid (H3PO4) can be produced by 3 main commercial methods: wet process,thermal process and dry kiln process.Wet process is by far the most common route and the acid can be used in phosphate fertilizers production (DAP,MAP,SPA).Thermal process phosphoric acid is of a much higher purity and is used in the manufacture of high gradeChapter 5 ~ Flows and Cycles of Nutrients Environmental,The phosphate ion (PO 4 3 ) is the most important form of plant available phosphorus Although phosphate ions typically occur in small concentrations in soil,they are constantly produced from slowly dissolving minerals such as calcium,magnesium,and iron phosphates (Ca 3 (PO 4) 2,Mg 3 (PO 4) 2,and FePO 4)
