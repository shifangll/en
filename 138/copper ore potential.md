## Copper Oxide
Copper oxide (CuO) nanoparticles have been characterized,both physically and chemically,and investigated with respect to potential antimicrobial applications [40].It was found that nanoscaled CuO,as generated by thermal plasma technology,demonstrated particle sizes in the range 20 95 nm with a mean surface area of 15.7 m 2 g ( Figure 10.1D ).A potential application of high voltage pulse technology …A potential application of high voltage pulse technology in a gold copper ore grinding circuit By Fengnian Shi,Narayan Krishnan,Frederic von der Weid,Klaas van der Wielen,Weiran Zuo and Emmanuel Manlapig Abstract Laboratory study has identified a new.
