## Cadmium
Cadmium is a chemical element with the symbol Cd and atomic number 48.This soft,silvery white metal is chemically similar to the two other stable metals in group 12,zinc and mercury.Like zinc,it demonstrates oxidation state +2 in most of its compounds,and like mercury,it has a lower melting point than the transition metals in groups 3 through 11.HafniumHafnium is a chemical element with the symbol Hf and atomic number 72.A lustrous,silvery gray,tetravalent transition metal,hafnium chemically resembles zirconium and is found in many zirconium minerals.Its existence was predicted by Dmitri Mendeleev in 1869,though it was not identified until 1923,by Coster and Hevesy,making it the last.
