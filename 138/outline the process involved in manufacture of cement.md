## 11.6 Portland Cement Manufacturing
11.6 Portland Cement Manufacturing 11.6.1 Process Description 7 Portland cement is a fine powder,gray or white in color,that consists of a mixture of hydraulic cement materials comprising primarily calcium silicates,aluminates and aluminoferrites.More than 30.Manufacturing process Lafarge in South AfricaVery fine grinding produces a fine powder,known as raw meal,which is preheated and then sent to the kiln.The material is heated to 1,500 C before being suddenly and dramatically cooled by bursts of air.This produces clinker,the basic material required for the production of all cements.
