## Coal: Anthracite,Bituminous,Coke,Pictures,Formation,Uses
Bituminous coal is formed when a sub bituminous coal is subjected to increased levels of organic metamorphism.It has a carbon content of between 77 and 87% on a dry ash free basis and a heating value that is much higher than lignite or sub bituminous coal.On the basisDifference Between Anthracite Coal and Bituminous Coal …Bituminous Coal Bituminous coal is the most abundant type coal.It is soft and contains a substance called bitumen,which is similar to tar.The carbon percentage in bituminous coal is normally between 87%.And there is water,hydrogen,sulfur and few

## Anthracite Coal
Anthracite Coal is a premium type of coal.It is very hard and compact.It is considered the highest quality of coal.It has the least amount of impurities,giving it the name “Clean Coal.” Anthracite coal has no soot residue and produces no smoke when consumed.Bituminous Coal is a “soft coal” that contains tar like particles within.Historic Structures &amp; Sites Mill Creek MetroParksIn the 1840′s,the Mill Creek Furnace was rebuilt to burn bituminous coal.The Mill Creek Furnace went out of blast in the late 1840s or early 1850s.In April of 2003,more than 180 years after the closing of the Mill Creek Furnace,John R.White,Department of Sociology and Anthropology,Youngstown State University,led an archaelogical dig.

Caking refers to the coal's ability to be converted into coke,a pure form of carbon that can be used in basic oxygen furnaces.Bituminous coal—generally classified as a metallurgical grade—is harder and blacker and contains more carbon and less moisture and ash than low rank coals.ExplorePAHistory.comThe shift to bituminous coal and coke occurred more slowly.In the 1810s,Thomas Lewis was the first to make coke in America,for Isaac Meason's rolling mill constructed at Plumsock and then at Bear Creek Furnace.These early coke furnaces,however,failed due to a weak blast,inferior coal and coke,
