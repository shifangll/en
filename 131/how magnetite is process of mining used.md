## Magnetite: The Future of Iron Ore
Magnetite ore,long the leading source of domestic iron supply in North America,Europe and China,is now increasingly relevant across the globe.The perception that magnetite ore is an inferior substitute to hematite ore is now firmly changing.As easily accessibly,economic hematite deposits become rarer,magnetite ore will continue to emerge as an […]Iron Ore AIMR 2011 Australian Mines AtlasAustralia’s iron ore reserves and resources are in both hematite and magnetite ores.Because of the high average grades (% Fe) of hematite ores when compared to the average grades for magnetite ores,it is necessary to report national resources in terms of contained iron.
