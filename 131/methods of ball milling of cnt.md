## Which method gives better uniform mixing of CNTs over metals.
I too was used Ball milling to mix,CNT and Aluminium.But if you are keeping CNT on Ball milling more than hours the outer most structure of CNT is getting.Dispersion of Multiwalled Carbon Nanotubes in Aluminum.CNT metal nanocomposites are mainly due to severe agglomeration of CNTs and low relative densities,ranged 85 95%.In this study dispersion of CNT in aluminum powder was carried out using ultrasonic and ball mill attrition and uniform distribution,without agglomeration of CNTs,was achieved.Keywords— Aluminum powder,Ball mill attrition.
