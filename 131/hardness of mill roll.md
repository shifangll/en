Hardness,microstructure and chemical composition of mill roller shells play a marked role in wear resistance.Although hardness and relative wear are linearly proportional for most of the commercial pure metals,the same simple relation does not hold for a range of mill roller shells where it becomes necessary to consider chemical composition.Mill Rolls For Different Rolling Processes TINVOThe mill rolls are mainly used for the rolling mill,which cause continuous plastic deformation of the metal.The mill roller is mainly composed of a roll body,a roll neck and a shaft head.The roll body is the middle part of the roll,which actually participates in the rolling.
