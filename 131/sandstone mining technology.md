## Mineral resources in Norway The Norwegian mining and
The Norwegian mining and quarrying industry had a turnover of approximately NOK 8.2 billion in 2004 (1.03 billion EUR) and employed some 5200 workers.It is a major industry in some regions of the country.The most important counties are Rogaland,M&#248re &amp Romsdal,Nordland,Vestfold and Finmark.Shale oil extraction WikipediaShale oil extraction is usually performed above ground (ex situ processing) by mining the oil shale and then treating it in processing facilities.Other modern technologies perform the processing underground (onsite or in situ processing) by applying heat and extracting the oil via oil wells.
