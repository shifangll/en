Rebar is used in concrete to provide additional strength,as concrete is weak in tension,while steel is strong in both tension and compression.Steel and concrete have similar coefficients of thermal expansion,so a concrete structural member reinforced with steel will experience minimal stress as the temperature changes.What is Reinforced Concrete? Uses,Benefits,and …8&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Reinforced concrete is a combination of traditional cement concrete with reinforcements (steel bar).This combination is made to use the compressive strength of concrete and tensile strength of steel at the same time,hence,work together to resist many types of loading.

steel reinforcing bars for typical reinforced concrete bridge decks5 The research indicates that,due to the use of high strength steel reinforcing bars,the required steel area can be reduced by up to 33% while maintaining comparable behavior to bridge decks reinforced with conventional Grade 60 (400 MPa) steel Detailing requirements.Reinforced SteelA model to illustrate synergistic role of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in initiating reinforced steel bar corrosion in sewage pipes is shown in Fig.12.18.SRB reduces sulfate constituents present in sewage and soil matter to sulfides leading to generation of gaseous H 2 S,dissolved H 2 S as well as various reduced sulfur species,all of which are known to corrode steel.

## Corrosion of Steel Reinforcement in Concrete
8&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;The corrosion of steel reinforcement in concrete is complex,but basically it is an electrochemical reaction similar to that of a simple battery.The composition of mild steel varies along its length and potential anodic (more negatively charged) and cathodic (positively charged) sites can be set up at various points.Reinforcing Bars Re Steel Supply Company,IncReinforcing bars conforming to ASTM A706 A706M specifications are recommended for use in seismic resistant reinforced concrete structures that require controlled tensile properties or for applications that involve extensive welding

## Concrete and reinforced concrete Explain that Stuff
The steel bars (known as rebar,short for reinforcing bar) are typically made from twisted strands with nobbles or ridges on them that anchor them firmly inside the concrete without any risk of slipping around inside it Theoretically,we could use all kinds of materials to reinforce concreteRebar WikipediaRebar (short for reinforcing bar),collectively known as reinforcing steel and reinforcement steel,is a steel bar or mesh of steel wires used as a tension device in reinforced concrete.
