## 23 Types of Concrete Used in Construction and their …
Different types of concrete are produced based on the constituent material,mix design,the method of construction,area of application,form of hydration reaction.Details of these various types of concrete,their properties and applications are discussed.Strength of Concrete vs Grades of Cement14&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;There are cases when the cements of certain grades give more than prescribed strength at 7 days and thereafter a very little gain in their strength is observed till 28 days and in some cases the strength does not reach the level as per the grade.There are also cases,where a 43 grade cement gives 28 day strength matching with 53 grade.
