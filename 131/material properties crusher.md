## Aggregates for Concrete
Crushed stone is produced by crushing quarry rock,boul ders,cobbles,or large size gravel.Crushed air cooled blast furnace slag is also used as fine or coarse aggregate.The aggregates are usually washed and graded at the pit or plant.Some variation in the type,quality,cleanli ness,grading,moisture content,and other properties is expected.Engineering Properties of Stones and Tests on Stones.Properties of Stones and Tests Applied on Stones.By: Haseeb Jamal On: Aug 31,2017 Stones,Lab Notes,Material Properties.Properties of Stones Strength &amp; Durability: The more compact grained and heavier a stone the harder it is.Due to alternate wetting and drying the resulting crushing strength can be reduced even up to 30 40%.
