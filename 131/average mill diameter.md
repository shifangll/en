## Millstone
Millstones or mill stones are stones used in gristmills,for grinding wheat or other grains.Millstones come in pairs.The base or bedstone is stationary.Above the bedstone is the turning runner stone which actually does the grinding.The runner stone spins above the stationary bedstone creating the &quot;scissoring&quot; or grinding action of the stones.Tubing: Minimum Wall Thickness Vs.Average Wall …Understanding the relationship between the outside diameter,nominal thickness and the average thickness of pipe tubing is important because it also directly relates to the working pressure that these tubes can withstand.As the outside diameter of the pipe increases,the allowable working pressure within the pipe decreases,unless there is a.14&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;feet increased an average of 7 percent (for logs 5.5 to 12 in.in diameter).This study proved that it is not necessary to obtain an extra board from the outside of the log as a result of accumulated kerf savings to increase lumber recovery.Without obtaining any extra boards,lumber recovery increases when a shift in the sawing pattern due to kerf
