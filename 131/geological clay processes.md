## 5.4 Weathering and the Formation of Soil Physical Geology
5.4 Weathering and the Formation of Soil.Weathering is a key part of the process of soil formation.but is dominated by clay minerals and quartz.Clay WikipediaClay is a finely grained natural rock or soil material that combines one or more clay minerals with traces of metal oxides and organic matter.Geologic clay deposits are mostly composed of phyllosilicate minerals containing variable amounts of water trapped in the mineral structure.Clays are plastic due to their water content&nbsp;.
