## Why is aluminium body considered better than magnesium?
Feb 07,2020&#0183;&#32;Both are alloys and probably contain some of the other in their mix In general,if you compared identical parts; one milled from billet and one cast from the same material,the billet part will be stronger But that is not the comparison Magnesium alloys are both lighter and stronger,particularly in thin wall constructionFormula SAE Cast Magnesium Wheels Deep Blue University of.Apr 17,2007.lighter than the three piece aluminum wheels we currently use,while improving stiffness.The primary problem with these wheels is their weight.At over five pounds.machining it out of a solid piece of billet magnesium.
