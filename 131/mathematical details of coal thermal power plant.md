## Electrical Modeling of a Thermal Power Station Diva
In Denmark,thermal power plants are in operation that do not cover base load In contrary,these plants run only for the sake of frequency control The configuration of these plants was modified so that fast responses in power generation are possible This effect is usually achieved by lowering the overall plant efficiency However,theThermal power station Wikipediamill model and to estimate the pulverised coal flow using real time on site plant data 2 COAL MILL MODELLING In thermal power plant,pulverization of coal is carried out by coal mill Raw coal is moved from the storage to the mill by conveyor mechanism The type of coal mill envisaged for our model is bowl mill which is shown in Fig1
