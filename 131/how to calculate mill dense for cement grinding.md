## Raw Material Preparation
From the early 1900s,both for cement grinding and for grinding hard raw materials,whether by wet or dry process,the standard arrangement was a ball mill for preliminary grinding (to below 0.75 mm),followed by a tube mill for fine grinding.Typically the ball mill was placed on an upper floor so that material could move by gravity.Cement millA cement mill (or finish mill in North American usage) is the equipment used to grind the hard,nodular clinker from the cement kiln into the fine grey powder that is cement.Most cement is currently ground in ball mills and also vertical roller mills which are more effective than ball mills.
