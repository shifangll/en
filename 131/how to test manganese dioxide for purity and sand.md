## How to Extract explosive Manganese Dioxide from batteries
Making your own explosives is fun stuff,but getting the many different materials that you need can be tricky.This video will show you how to extract Manganese Dioxide from alkaline batteries,which you can then combine with hydrogen peroxide to create oxygen gas,which is very explosive indeed.MnO2 Anodes OoCitiesA test tube was about 1 2 filled with an ~ 50% solution of Cobalt Nitrate Hexahydrate.This seems to result in denser sand sized crystallites forming.3) The 4th Co3O4 interface coat was alternated with the 1st MnO2 coat.This is a standard method of preparing decent purity salts from sources of unknown purity.
