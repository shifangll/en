## Copper(II) oxide CuO PubChem
Hydrometallurgy is the most common method for the production of copper(II) oxide A solution of ammonia and ammonium carbonate in the presence of air effectively leaches metallic copper into solution,the solution is stripped of ammonia and carbon dioxide by steam injection or pressurized boiling to produce black copper(II) oxideFlotation of a Copper Lead Sulfide Oxide Ore：Using a Combined.Results in closed circuit test show that when the feed assays 0.59% Cu,2.40% Pb and 39.87 g t Ag,marketable copper sulfide and oxide concentrates,lead.

## 12.3 Primary Copper Smelting
2015910&ensp&#0183&enspcharge material of copper concentrate mixed with a siliceous flux (often a lowgrade copper ore) is heated in air to about 650&#176C (1200&#176F),eliminating 20 to 50 percent of the sulfur as sulfur dioxide (SO2).Portions of impurities such as antimony,arsenic,and lead are driven off,and some iron is converted to iron oxide.Copper Hydrometallurgical Pilot Plant Core GroupThe project investigated hydrometallurgical options for recovery of copper in flotation tailings,that would be sent to the tailings dam from a copper processing circuit Precipitated copper oxide products generated from the piloted leach process are to be blended back into the primary copper concentrate generated by the flotation plant
