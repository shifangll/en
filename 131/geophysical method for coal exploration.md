## Surface and Subsurface Methods of Mineral Exploration
Surface and Subsurface Methods of Mineral Exploration.The major motive in exploring the earth’s surface and its interior is scientific curiosity or the desire to understand better the nature of the Earth.Borehole electromagnetic method for exploration of coal.At present,many geophysical methods have been adopted to prospect coal mining goaf.However,each method has its own disadvantage which limits the validity for prospecting coal mining goafs,particularly for multilayer goafs.In this paper,a borehole electromagnetic method is developed to explore the coal mining goafs.

## Radiometrics Geoscience Australia
The radiometric,or gamma ray spectrometric method is a geophysical process used to estimate concentrations of the radioelements potassium,uranium and thorium by measuring the gamma rays which the radioactive isotopes of these elements emit during radioactive decay.Geophysical Methods of Soil Exploration Soil EngineeringThe following points highlight the two main geophysical methods of soil exploration.The methods are: 1.Seismic Refraction Method 2.Electrical Resistivity Method.1.Seismic Refraction Method: The seismic refraction method is based on the principle that elastic shock waves travel at different velocities in different materials.
