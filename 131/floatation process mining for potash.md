## US5456362A Flutation process for the flutation of coarse,
A process for the flotation of coarse potash ore fractions in an aqueous brine containing frother that comprises: (a) using a column flotation device in which air bubbles are generated by a sparger that utilizes high intensity shearing to mix and disperse air into brine containing frother; (b) removing a portion of the suspension at another point in the direction of flow of the suspension to.Potash Mine Near Moab,Utah earthobservatorynasagovThe crystals of potash and salt are then sent to a facility to be separated through a flotation process In 2013,the United States produced about 970,000 metric tons of potash,about two percent of global production
