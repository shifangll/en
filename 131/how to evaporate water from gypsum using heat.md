ReferenceWater evaporates faster at higher temperatures,when its surface area increases and when exposed to moving air.The concentration of water and other substances in the surrounding air and air pressure also affect evaporation rate.Raising the temperature of water increases the kinetic energy of surface molecules,hastening the rate of evaporation.

## What happens when plaster of Paris reacts with water?
Plaster of Paris when reacts with water liberating heat through crystallization Gypsum is produced by heating plaster of paris to about 150 degree Celsius When the dry plaster of paris powder is mixed with water it reforms into gypsum Depending upon the temperature gypsum converts to hemihydrate or anhydrous formWater Heat of Vaporization vs TemperatureThe (latent) heat of vaporization (∆H vap) also known as the enthalpy of vaporization or evaporation,is the amount of energy (enthalpy) that must be added to a liquid substance,to transform a given quantity of the substance into a gas The enthalpy of vaporization is a function of the pressure at which that transformation takes place The heat of vaporization diminishes,
