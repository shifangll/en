## Aggradation Wikipedia
Aggradation can be caused by changes in climate,land use,and geologic activity,such as volcanic eruption,earthquakes,and faulting.For example,volcanic eruptions may lead to rivers carrying more sediment than the flow can transport: this leads to the burial of the old channel and its floodplain.In another example,the&nbsp;.Aggradation an overview ScienceDirect TopicsIncision of the channel bed can be the result of base level change,vertical crustal movements,or changes in Q w relative to Q s (Figure 3(a)) However,changes in the discharge regime alone (ie,the ‘flashiness’ of discharge) can cause floodplain aggradation or degradation,without vertical changes in the channel bed

## Environmental Risks of Mining
Underground mining has the potential for tunnel collapses and land subsidence (Betournay,2011) It involves large scale movements of waste rock and vegetation,similar to open pit mining Additionally,like most traditional forms of mining,underground mining can release toxic compounds into the air and waterSumitomo Metal Mining doubles annual profit f'cast on,Nov 08,2021&#0183;&#32;TOKYO : Japan's Sumitomo Metal Mining Co Ltd more than doubled its annual profit forecast on Monday thanks to surging prices of copper and nickel as well as a one off gain from selling its stake.
