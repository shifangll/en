Although concrete has very high compression strength,it has very little tensile strength (resistance to being pulled apart).Because concrete is made from water,it shrinks as it cures,at a rate of about 1 16th of an inch for every 10 feet,there is strong tension pulling the cement slab.Different Types of Concrete Grades and their uses Base,Concrete mixes are defined in ascending numbers of 5,starting at 10,and show the compressive strength of the concrete after 28 days For instance,C10 has the strength of 10 newtons,C15 has the strength of 15 newtons,C20 has 20 newtons strength and so on
