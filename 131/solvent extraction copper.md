## Understanding aqueous in organic entrainment in copper solvent.
Introduction.Many copper solvent extraction (SX) plants experience high aqueous in organic (A in O) entrainments but are unaware of the extent of the problem because entrainment is often not measured.Aqueous entrainment results in the carry over of unwanted species into the electrowinning (EW) process and the need&nbsp;.Metals Recycling From Waste Sludges by Ammoniacal Leaching…From Waste Sludges by Ammoniacal Leaching Followed by Solvent Extraction techniques and solvent extraction reagents to recycle nickel,copper,cobalt,
