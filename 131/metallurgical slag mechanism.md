## Dissolution mechanism of various elements from steelmaking
Abstract To recycle valuable elements from steelmaking slag,their dissolution mechanism into citric acid solution has been investigated.First,the relationship between dissolution ratio of each element and initial concentration of citric acid (c i) was studied.Then,the concentrations of each species in solution were calculated through mass balance.ASI International NewsARTICLE Mechanism and Reduction of Insoluble Slag or Dross for Cleaner Metal By Rod Naro,Mark King,D.C.Williams and Lenny Basaj.Increasing cell count in grey iron,especially for thin section castings Understanding the sulfur effect in treated ductile iron for a given magnesium content

Abstract: Using ladle slag,ferrovanadium smelting slag as well as metallurgical auxiliary materials as raw materials,the converter slag with SiO 2 content of 11.3% to 2.8%,Al 2 O 3 content of 3.3% to 19.4% were prepared.The melting characteristics of slag were measured,at 1600 &#176C both dephosphorization and desulfurization tests of slag were conducted in atmosphere furnace.Slag Metal Reactions in Welding :: Total Materia ArticleSlag metal reactions are of importance in many fusion welding processes,but comparatively little is known about mechanisms which control them.The predominant reason for this is that slagmetal reactions have been associated primarily with the arc welding of ferrous materials,and they are therefore only a part of the difficult problem of
