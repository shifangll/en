## Coal fired power plant
Coal fired power plants are a type of power plant that make use of the combustion of coal in order to generate electricity.Their use provides around 40% of the world's electricity and they are primarily used in developing countries.Countries such as South Africa use coal for 94% of their electricity and China and India use coal for 70 75% of their electricity nEnergy conversion technology BritannicaEnergy conversion,the transformation of energy from forms provided by nature to forms that can be used by humans.Over the centuries a wide array of devices and systems has been developed for this purpose.Some of these energy converters are quite simple.The early windmills,for example,
