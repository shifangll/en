## Manufacturing process &lt; All about Cement &lt; Cement : Lafarge Jordan
The raw materials needed to produce cement (calcium carbonate,silica,alumina and iron ore) are generally extracted from limestone rock,chalk,clayey schist or clay.Suitable reserves can be found in most countries.These raw materials are extracted from the quarry by blasting.They are then crushed and transported to&nbsp;.Raw materials for cement manufacturing AEIFOROS METAL.Raw materials for cement manufacturing: Electric Arc Furnace slag,EAF slag,Ladle Furnace slag,LF slag,mill scale,manufacture of cement,raw material for the cement industry.

## 3.3 Raw Materials for Cement Manufacture
3.3 Raw materials for cement manufacture.The first step in the manufacture of portland cement is to combine a variety of raw ingredients so that the resulting cement will have the desired chemical composition.These ingredients are ground into small particles to make them more reactive,blended together,and then the&nbsp;.Use of recycled glass as a raw material in the manufacture of.Most of the waste glass is sodium lime silicate glass which has,more or less,similar chemical compositions to clay,a raw material in cement manufacturing.Therefore,we utilize the solid waste in cement raw mix by replacing part of the clayey component.In this study,the effects of the glass in cement raw mix on clinker&nbsp;.
