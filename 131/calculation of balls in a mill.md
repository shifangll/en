## THE BULK WEIGHT OF GRINDING BALLS
&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;In the grinding material process at ball mills becomes necessary to calculate the bulk weigh of used grinding media.The bulk weigh of the grinding balls is necessary to understand the grinding balls mass in the cube,the grinding balls mass loaded into the mill,the prevention of mill overloading with grinding balls,etc.These data often used in operational management of grinding …Ball mill WikipediaA ball mill is a type of grinder used to grind and blend materials for use in mineral dressing processes,paints,pyrotechnics,ceramics and selective laser sintering.It works on the principle of impact and attrition: size reduction is done by impact as the balls drop from near the top of the shell.
