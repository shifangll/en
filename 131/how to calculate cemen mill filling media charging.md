## How Can I calculate new ball size and weight desing for
Mar 10,2011&nbsp&#0183&#32Re: How Can I calculate new ball size and weight desing for ball mill.Hi,We have a similar mill.Pregrinding with hammer crusher and monochamber mill.Thisis what a proposed based on literture review i did and others agree its more and less correct.But remember it all depends on your mill feed size after pregrinding.Optimization of continuous ball mills used for finish grinding of.On Dec 1,2004 R.Schnatz published: Optimization of continuous ball mills used for finish grinding of cement by varying the L D ratio,ball charge filling ratio,ball size and.[21]studied the effect of the grinding media filling on impact load,concluding that the impact load on the lifters increases as the filling level decreases.
