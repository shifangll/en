## Measuring the plasticity of clays: A review ScienceDirect
In traditional clay containing ceramic materials,the measurement and control of the plasticity are needed to characterize the system and to optimize the conditions of the processing (Ribeiro et al,2005) Factors influencing plasticity may be related to the clay itself or to the molding process (Henry,1943,Carman,1949,Marshall,1955)Aggregates Particle Testing Standards ANSI Webstore1.2 This test method is not intended to be used with lightweight aggregates.Standard Test Method for Measurement of Hydraulic Conductivity of Materials Derived.Standard Test Method for Clay Lumps and Friable Particles in Aggregates.
