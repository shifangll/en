## CO 2 Removal from Syngas Membrane Technology
CO 2 Removal from Syngas Problem.Syngas is produced via partial oxidation of a carbon source (coal,natural gas,or biomas) using oxygen (or air) and steam.Cost comparison of syngas production from natural gasA sensitivity analysis was conducted to investigate how the cost varies with coal depth and thickness.It was found that by utilizing thicker coal seams,syngas production per cavity can be increased,and the number of new wells drilled per year can be reduced,therefore improving the economics of UCG.
