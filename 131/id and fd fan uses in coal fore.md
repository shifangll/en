## What is the difference between ID fan and FD fan? Quora
PA fans are typical in coal burning operations,as more air is needed for the complete combustion of coal than an FD fan alone can provide PA fans also provide transport and tempering air that is used to move pulverized coal from storage to the furnaceUpgrading and efficiency improvement in coal fired …The efficiencies of coal fired plants will normally decrease over time as components suffer deterioration with age and use.
