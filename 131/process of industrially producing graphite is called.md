## Graphite manufacturing process [SubsTech]
Pyrolytic graphite is a form of graphite produced by high temperature decomposition of hydrocarbon gases in vacuum followed by deposition of the carbon atoms to the substrate surface.The process is called Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD).Electrical discharge machining WikipediaElectrical discharge machining (EDM).In this case,the correspondent EDM process is also called wire EDM.The tool electrode can also be used in such a way that only a small portion of it is actually engaged in the machining process and this portion is changed on a regular basis.The problem of wear to graphite electrodes is being.
