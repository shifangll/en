After ball milling,the intensities of the characteristic peaks of methylene (2923 and 2850 cm−1) and ether (1248 and 1160 cm−1) were weakened This result illustrated that the main chain of phenolic resin was broken and the tail end of the broken part formed free radicals29 In addition,the characterMechanical Milling: a Top Down Approach for the Synthesis,Synthesis of nanomaterials by a simple,low cost and in high yield has been a great challenge since the very early development of nanoscience Various bottom and top down approaches have been developed so far,for the commercial production of nanomaterials Among all top down approaches,high energy ball milling,has been widely exploited for the synthesis of various nanomaterials,nanograins.
