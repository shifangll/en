## Iron ores an overview ScienceDirect Topics
Low grade iron ore mined from the earth is usually composed of several minerals.different minerals according to their differences in magnetic susceptibility.iron ores can be divided into high grade hematite ores,with 64 67% Fe and low SiO2.also with reverse flotation or gravity concentration to reduce silica content.Iron Ore (Fe) Minerals Deposits in Nigeria States,and UsesIron ore contains four main types of iron oxides deposits solely dependent on the mineralogy and geology of the ore deposits,these includes magnetite,titanomagnetite,hematite and pisolitic ironstone,out of the four the two most important minerals deposits are hematite (Fe 2 O 3) and magnetite (Fe 3 O 4) The method of Iron ore mining varies.
