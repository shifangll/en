## High speed grinding of particulate reinforced titanium …
This paper aims at investigating the machinability of particulate reinforced titanium matrix composites (PTMCs) during high speed grinding (80 140&amp;nbsp;m s) using a monolayer brazed cubic boron nitride (CBN) superabrasive wheel.The removal mechanism of the hard brittle reinforcements of PTMCs is discussed based on finite element simulation.Results obtained show that the grinding forces.Particulate Emission Factors for Blasting Operations and Other …Task 1: Shipyard Sources of Particulate Matter Task 2: Abrasive Blasting Emission Factors Task 3: Survey of U.S.Shipbuilding and Repair Industry Dry Abrasive Blast Media and Equipment Usage Task 4: Shipyard Abrasive Blasting Particulate Emission Factor.
