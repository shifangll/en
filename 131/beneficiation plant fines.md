2013 2 21&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;NEED &amp; JUSTIFICATION OF TREATING COAL FINES The Coal Beneficiation Plants installed in 1960’s did not include coal fines circuit.The quality of fines were acceptable for blending with coarse coal cleans for producing metallurgical coke.The depletion of good quality coking coal reserves and inclusion of feed fines from open cast mines,Characterization and Beneficiation of Dry Iron Ore.Characterization and beneficiation of dry iron ore processing plant reject fines of Khondbond region,India,was investigated.Different characterization techniques viz.size analysis,size wise chemical and density analysis,X ray diffraction analysis,sink float analysis,thermo gravimetric analysis,scanning electron microscopy,and QEMSCAN were carried out.Based on characterization.

## Characteristics of an improved collector derived from a waste of coal.
Characteristics of an improved collector derived from a waste of coal processing plant for the beneficiation of Indian coking coal fines by froth flotation.Coal Beneficiation Process Diagram2020 2 24&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Many breakers and washeries efficiently handle the coarser sizes,but waste the coal fines.This problem is assuming major importance due to the increase in the amount of coal fines being produced by the mechanization of coal mining.Flotation offers a very satisfactory low cost method for recovering a fine,low ash,clean coal product at a profit.
