## What is Depth of Cut in Machining? Its Unit,Value.
Selection and value of depth of cut.Since depth of cut value is an important parameter that influences overall machining performance as well as economy,so an optimum value must be selected judiciously after considering a number of relevant factors.Usually,in conventional machining operations,depth of cut value varies between 0.1 1.0mm.
