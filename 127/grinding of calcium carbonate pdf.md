## Calcium Carbonate NETZSCH Grinding & Dispersing
Calcium carbonate (CaCO 3),which occurs primarily in the form of the minerals calcite and aragonite,is one of the most prevalent compounds on Earth.Calcium carbonate is not only the main component of marble,limestone and dolomite,it is also found in bones and teeth as well as the exoskeleton of crustaceans,coral,muscles,snails and protozoa.CN101875793A Production method for superfine modified,The invention relates to a production method for superfine modified heavy calcium carbonate by wet grinding,which mainly comprises the following steps of: 1) adding calcite into a jaw crusher to obtain crushed coarse grains; 2) feeding the crushed coarse grains by using a vibrating machine into a flour mill for grinding,collecting and performing tons of packaging; 3) uniformly,
