## Limits on Alkali Content in Cement—Results from a Field Study
ASTM C 150 has optional limits on the equivalent alkalies in portland cement expressed as %Na 2 O + 0.658 × %K 2 O),often referred to as “Na 2 Oeq” where alkali silica reactivity is a potential problem.The prescribed limit of 0.6% by mass of the cement,which was developed over 40 years ago.CEMENT scetcivilFUNCTION OF CEMENT üto bind the sand and coarse aggregate together üto fill voids in between sand and coarse aggregate particle üto form a compact mass.Types of Cement ü2 types of cement normally used in building industry are as follows: a) Hydraulic Cement b) Nonhydraulic Cement.Hydraulic Cement üHydraulic Cement sets and hardens by.
