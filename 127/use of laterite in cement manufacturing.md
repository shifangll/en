Laterite is soil type rich in iron,formed in hot and wet tropical areas.Laterite is rusty red in colour because of iron oxides.It is developed by intensive and long lasting weathering of the underlying parent rock.Tropical weathering (laterization) is a prolonged process of chemical weathering which produces a wide variety in the thickness.Durability performance of concrete containing laterite aggregates.Studies found that the use of 20 to 30% of laterite aggregates,as partial replacement for coarse aggregates,results in concrete with the targeted strength.
