## EGR Systems and Lubricating Oil in Diesel Engines
Diesel engines using EGR systems to lubricate oils will also require higher a level of dispersancy because of increased soot loading in the oil.Without increased dispersancy,the higher levels of soot and particulate matter will not stay in suspension in the form of smaller material,increasing wear to liner,ring and valve train.The new American Petroleum Institute (API) engine oils are.The VW scandal exposes the high tech control of engine emissions8 Oct 2015.The computer also controls the EGR and SCR in modern engines including the amount of exhaust gas which is recycled or ammonia injected.Without access to the source code,we don&#39;t know what the difference is between the “map” for normal driving and the “map” for emissions testing in affected&nbsp;.
