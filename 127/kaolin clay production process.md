Our white kaolin clay is from deposits in Texas,USA and is heat treated to remove some portion of its hydroxyl (OH) composition Calcined kaolin is produced by heating ultrafine natural kaolinite to high temperatures in a kiln The calcination process increases whiteness and hardness and alters the size and shape of the kaolin particlClay Processing FEECO International IncMaterial Processing Agglomeration Clay is frequently agglomerated to improve handling and performance across many applications Whether you need to create a micro pelletized product,or you’d like to turn fines into pellets,FEECO can serve all of your clay agglomeration and pelletizing needs with our agglomeration drums,disc pelletizers,pin mixers,and pug mills,as well as our.
