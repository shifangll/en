In case of continuously operated ball mill,the material to be ground is fed from the left through a 60° cone and the product is discharged through a 30° cone to the right.As the shell rotates,the balls are lifted up on the rising side of the shell and then they cascade down (or drop down on to the feed),from near the top of the&nbsp;.Ball MillsIt may sometimes be recommended also for finer grinding.Within these limits a rod mill is usually superior to and more efficient than a ball mill.The basic principle for rod grinding is reduction by line contact between rods extending the full length of the mill,resulting in selective grinding carried out on the largest particle sizes.
