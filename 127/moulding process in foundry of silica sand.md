## Casting Processes
Shell Process (Core and Molding) is a sand process.The sand,usually silica,is coated with a plastic resin.The sand is blown or "invested" into a heated metal box.The heat of the box cures the resin thus hardening the sand.Sand Casting Foundry Manufacturing ProcessEvery sand casting foundry follows a somewhat similar process in manufacturing components.After all,sand casting has been around for over 3,000 years.
