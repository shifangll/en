## Online Particle Size Measurement System.MYTA
The online particle size measurement system MYTA is suitable for measuring particle size in real time in hammer mills or grist mills at breweries and distilleries.In hammer mills,also sieve breakage can be detected via changes in the particle size with the online particle size measurement unit.Ongoing identiﬁ cation of particle size.Hammermill tip speed adjustment alters particle size.Traditionally,the most common method of changing the particle size is to exchange the size of screens for either a smaller or larger hole diameter.Screen changes lead to increased down time and loss of production within a facility.An alternative solution to reducing particle size is to adjust the hammer tip speed.
