## Methods of production Wikipedia
Production methods fall into three main categories: job (one off production),batch (multiple items,one step at a time for all items),and flow.Flow production (Process Production) is also a very common method of production.of certain components or even the whole product; large assembly lines are generally not used.5 field operations INfunction is to proportion the various components in the exact quantities.placed at permanent locations that produce large quantities of concrete.The function of a central mix.flow of aggregates during this transfer is controlled to measure the exact.construction because this method allows the placement of concrete at.
