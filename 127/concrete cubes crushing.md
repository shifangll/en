## Cube dimensions and strength Concrete Society
The concrete structural code Eurocode 2 (BS EN 1992) is based on cylinder.In the UK,BS 8500 states that the compressive strength of 150mm cubes and&nbsp;.Why do we always use 15*15*15 cm^3 cement concrete cube.Therefore,150mmx150mmx150mm concrete cubes are used instead to increase the applied stress to crush the concrete cubes.For normal concrete strength,the cube size of 150mmx150mmx150mm is already sufficient for the crushing strength of the machine.Thanks.778 Views · Answer requested by.
