## Cement: Materials and manufacturing process GreenSpec
Carboniferous limestones are the major source of raw material in Britain.The other main limestones are Cretaceous (Chalk) and Jurassic.• Chalk is porous and often has high moisture content that leads it to its use in the &#39;semi dry wet&#39; manufacturing process of making cement.This particular process represents some 16%&nbsp;.Manufacturing process Lafarge in South Africa Cement.The raw materials needed to produce cement (calcium carbonate,silica,alumina and iron ore) are generally extracted from limestone rock,chalk,clayey schist or clay.
