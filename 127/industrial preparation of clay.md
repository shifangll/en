## Preparation and Properties of Clay Reinforced Epoxy.
The clay reinforced epoxy nanocomposite was prepared by the polymerization method.The effect of clay addition on the mechanical properties of epoxy clay nanocomposites was studied through tensile,flexural,impact strength,and fracture toughness tests.The morphology and tribology behavior of epoxy clay nanocomposites were determined by X ray diffraction (XRD) and wear test,respectively.(PDF) Industrial ClaysThe industrial clay deposits are classified as primary,residual formed from in situ alteration of various precursors or hydrothermal) and secondary,formed from deposition of clastic clay.
