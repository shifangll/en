Why is it important to let clay work dry slow? Be aware that the larger to piece is,the more movement of shrinkage will take place.For a example,if clay shrinks 5% during drying,a piece of clay that is 5" long,will shrink 1 4" and a piece that is 20" long,will shrink 1" during the drying.Burnt clay bricks fao.orgThe clay is obtained by chipping it out of a clay bank and when necessary,mixing it with sand to a mixture that will not crack during drying.Water is gradually added to make the clay plastic.In making bricks,the mould must be cleaned periodically with water.Before each brick is formed,the mould is sprinkled with sand.
