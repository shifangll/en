## Aggregate Abrasion Machine Cooper Technology
Inadequate abrasion resistance of road surfacing aggregates means an early loss of the texture depth required to maintain high speed skidding resistance The Cooper Aggregate Abrasion machine determines the Aggregate Abrasion Value by testing the measure of the resistance of aggregate to surface wear by abrasionPavement materials: Aggregates IIT BombayOverview RYAN Aggregate is a collective term for the mineral materials such as sand,gravel,and crushed stone that are used with a binding medium (such as water,bitumen,Portland cement,lime,etc) to form compound materials (such as bituminous concrete and Portland cement concrete)

## A new practical method for determining the LA abrasion,
The LA abrasion method suffers from several drawbacks including the time needed to perform the test,the operational noise and dust and the space required by the machine The objective of this study was to investigate whether the modified compaction method can be a suitable alternative for determining the LA abrasion valueLos Angeles Abrasion Test on Aggregate GharpediaLos Angeles Abrasion Test on Aggregate,The maximum Los Angeles abrasion value should not be more than 30% for the use of wearing surface and not more than 50% for the use of concrete Table 1 below presents the average Los Angeles abrasion test value for rocks of different groups

## WHAT ARE THE PROPERTIES OF AGGREGATES FOR CONCRETE,
The impact value of an aggregate is sometime used as an alternative to its crushing value Also read: Impact Value Test of Aggregat 14 Abrasion Value of Aggregat The abrasion value gives a relative measure of resistance of an aggregate to wear when it is rotated in a cylinder along with some abrasive chargeEffects of Los Angeles Abrasion Test Values on the,aggregate samples to calculate the LA abrasion loss The authors found that the LA abrasion test was a consistent method of detecting weak materials and was a means of pre&#173; dicting aggregate impact value and aggregate crushing value Wylde (11) reviewed and investigated the road failures.
