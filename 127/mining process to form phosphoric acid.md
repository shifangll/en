## Byproducts The Phosphate Risk
In Florida,the phosphate rock is sent to processing plants in which it undergoes "wet process" to convert it into phosphoric acid.In the process,sulfuric acid is added to the phosphate to create phosphoric acid — which is easily absorbed by plants.Technologies for Uranium Recovery from Phosphoric Acid.Technologies for Uranium Recovery from Phosphoric Acid Presented at AIChE Central Florida Section 2008 Clearwater Convention June 7,2008 By: Marten Walters (Jacobs Engineering Group Inc.),Thomas Baroody and Wes Berry (K Technologies,Inc.)

## Phosphate ore processing for phosphoric acid production.
Phosphoric acid (H 3 PO 4,PA) is an industrial acid,produced from two main types of phosphate rock: sedimentary and igneous.In the classical wet process,wet process PA is produced by a reaction between the ore and sulphuric acid,forming 30% solids thick slurry,in three stages: acidulation,filtration and concentration to produce a 50%P 2 O 5 acid.In a novel process,the phosphate ore is.Chemical Processing of Phosphate Florida Industrial and.Chemical Processing of Phosphate.The phosphate mineral as it exists in the ground is not soluble and is hard for the plant to access.To provide the plant with the phosphate it needs,in a form it can take up through its roots,the phosphate rock is converted to phosphoric acid.
