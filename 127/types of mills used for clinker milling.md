A raw mill is the equipment used to grind raw materials into &quot;rawmix&quot; during the manufacture of cement.Rawmix is then fed to a cement kiln,which transforms it into clinker,which is then ground to make cement in the cement mill.The raw milling stage of the process effectively defines the chemistry (and therefore physical properties) of the finished cement,and has a large effect upon the.Cement Ball MillOverview.The ball mill for clinker is an efficient tool for fine powder grinding.It is mainly used to grind the clinker and raw materials in cement industry and also can be applied in metallurgy,chemical,electric power and other industries to grind all kinds of ores.
