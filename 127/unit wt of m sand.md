## Dry Unit Weight
The dry unit weights of the soft soils derived from the laboratory testing are shown in Table 25.7.Out of a total of 80 peat samples tested,the dry unit weight of 80% of the samples were below 0.8 t m 3 and only 2 samples had dry unit weights of greater than 1.5 t m 3.The mean dry unit weight for 80% of the samples below 0.8 t m 3 is 0.41 t m 3.Basic definitions of SoilsStress kilopascals (kPa) 1 kPa = 1 kN m2 Unit Weight kN m3 To sufficient accuracy the density of water ρw is given by ρw = 1 tonne m 3 = 1 g cm3 In most applications it is not the mass that is important,but the force due to the mass,and the weight,W,is related to the mass,M,by the relation W = M g
