19 Dec 2008.Though the technology is still advancing,gasification is a well established process commonly used to improve efficiency of coal fired power plants.The gasification is typically carried out with steam and controlled amounts of oxygen at high temperature and pressure,to produce a clean burning fuel known&nbsp;.Alternate Uses Earth Resources4 Mar 2016.Gaseous products.Gasification can be used to convert solid coal into a gaseous feedstock,which can be used to make a range of other products.Gasification produces synthesis gas or syngas,a mixture of mostly carbon monoxide and hydrogen.The process can also help with separation of carbon dioxide&nbsp;.

## Coal to liquid (CTL) is a process of converting coal into a liquid fuel.
According to the World Coal Association,two different conversion processes exist: 1.Direct liquefaction works by dissolving the coal in a solvent at high temperature and pressure.This process is highly efficient,but the liquid products require further refining to achieve high grade fuel characteristics.2.Indirect liquefaction&nbsp;.Coal Gasification and Its Applications ScienceDirectThis book approaches coal gasification and related technologies from a process engineering point of view,with topics chosen to aid the process engineer who is interested in a complete,coal to products system.It provides a perspective for engineers and scientists who analyze and improve components of coal conversion&nbsp;.

## Coal Conversion Processes CiteSeerX
15 Nov 2002.[Top of Page].Coal gasification is the process of reacting coal with oxygen,steam,and carbon dioxide to form a product gas containing hydrogen and carbon monoxide.Gasification is essentially incomplete combustion.The chemical and physical processes are quite similar; the main difference being the.Coal to Clean Gasoline ExxonMobilfor converting coal to transportation fuels through gasification (Figure 1).The widely known Fischer .Tropsch process was first discovered in the 1920s.It has been commercially practiced by Sasol in several different forms to produce fuels from either coal or natural gas.No commercial scale coal to liquid (CTL).
