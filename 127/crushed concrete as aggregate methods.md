SAMPLING METHOD MB1 SAMPLING OF STOCKPILES 1 SCOPE This method describes the procedure to be followed when stockpiles are sampled (see 6.1).The stockpiles may consist of: Natural gravel,soil or sand; Crushed rock for base or subbase; Screened out crusher dust for binder,fine aggregate for concrete or fine aggregate for bituminous mixes; Crushed single sized aggregate …Crushed Concrete Rock Aggregates NowCrushed concrete can be used as material in temporary roads,construction staging areas,drilling pads,building pad caps,construction entrances,drainage fill and flexible base under paving.Smaller pieces of concrete can be used as gravel in new construction projects.

Crushed stone or crushed gravel >= 85 percent virgin aggregates Crushed concrete >= 90 percent crushed concrete that is substantially free of steel reinforcement and includes < 10 percent asphaltic pavement or surfacing,base,or a combination of asphaltic pavement,surfacing,and base,incorporated during the removal operation.Reclaimed asphalt >= 75 percent asphaltic pavement or surfacing.Concrete and Aggregate Testing Construction SGSConcrete and aggregate used in your construction projects has to meet strict regulations and quality standards.As these standards are often compulsory,concrete and aggregate testing by an independent third party is necessary to help assure compliance.
