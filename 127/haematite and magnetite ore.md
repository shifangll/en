## Types of Iron Ore: Hematite vs.Magnetite
Magnetite ore’s most distinctive property is its magnetism.It is the most magnetic mineral in the world.Additionally,obtaining iron from hematite ore can produce a great deal of carbon emissions,and the process for magnetite ore is much less harmful.Iron Ore ScienceViewsIron is one of the most abundant elements on Earth,but it does not occur in nature in useful metallic form.&quot;Iron ore&quot; is the term applied to a natural iron bearing.
