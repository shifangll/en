## How Does a Hammer Mill Work?
&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;Hammer mills work in the principle that most materials will crush,shatter,or pulverize upon impact.4.The Process: Material is fed into the mill grinding chamber through the feed chute,typically by gravity.It repeatedly is struck by ganged hammers which are attached to a shaft which rotaHammer MillsFEECO Hammer Mills.The FEECO double rotor hammer mill is a super heavy duty mill adapted to do the toughest jobs with two sets of chain bar links.Our hammer mills reduce dry and semi moist materials with a minimum amount of fines and caking or plastering within the crusher.They are ideal for granulated and pelletized materials.
