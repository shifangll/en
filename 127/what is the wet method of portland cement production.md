Because the sialite binary wet cement has a hydration mechanism different from that of “one component” cement such as Portland cement,and it has good consolidation ability to a3 is a flowchart graph for producing the “male body” of the sialite binary wet cement by dry milling method.What are the differences between the wet and dry processes.What are the differences between the wet and dry processes of a cement manufacturer? A:.Traditionally,the wet process was used in the absence of efficient mixing methods.Making a slurry offers better control over the chemistry of the mixture,resulting in a granular crumble that is best for heating in the kiln.The main disadvantage of.
