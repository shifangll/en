## Wet Curing and Drying Time wagnermeters.com
With wet curing,the added moisture serves to stabilize the excess loss of evaporated water in concrete.However,surface moisture interacts with slab water vapor that migrates from the bottom to the top of the slab.Moisture in the drying process must leave the slab by evaporating from the slab surface.
