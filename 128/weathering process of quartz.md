## Weathering Processes Physical Geography
Weathering is the process that changes solid rock into sediments.With weathering,rock is disintegrated into smaller pieces.Once these sediments are separated from the rocks,erosion is the process that moves the sediments away from it’s original position.The.Cryogenic Weathering of Granite,Northern Victoria Land,…Cavernous weathering phenomena (‘tafoni’) are well developed on the granitic and gneissic metasedimentary rock of the Northern Foothills region of Antarctica.Thin sections of weathered bedrock indicate that physical disintegration is associated with the preferential micro‐fracturing of quartz minerals.The enhanced susceptibility of quartz to fracture under cryogenic conditions.

Others,especially silicate minerals,are altered by a chemical process called hydrolysis.So it makes sense that isolated tetrahedra are the least stable in weathering,while quartz,which is completely formed of interlocking silica tetrahedra with no intervening.Weathering Section 1 Baraboo,WI 53913Weathering Section 1 Weathering and erosion generally go hand in hand but the two terms have subtly different scientific meanings.Weathering is the name given to processes that change the surface material of the Earth as a result of exposure to the effects of water and the atmosphere.Erosion means the removal or transportation of material.
