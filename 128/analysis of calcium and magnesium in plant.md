## Chapter 14.Calcium And Soil PH NOFA Interstate Council.
The principal exchangeable cations are calcium,magnesium,potassium,hydrogen,in many areas aluminum,and in acid soils ammonium.In a soil containing mostly calcium,the majority of the exchangeable cations are calcium ions.Exchangeable calcium,magnesium,potassium and ammonium are directly available to plants.Merging zones in flow injection analysis: Part 2.Determination of.A flow injection analysis system is described for the automatic determination of calcium,magnesium and potassium in plant material by atomic absorption and flame emission Spectrometry.Flow rates and damping factors were studied; the sample undergoes a dispersion of ca.40 fold with automatic incorporation of&nbsp;.
