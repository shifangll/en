## Titanium dioxide
Titanium dioxide,also known as titanium(IV) oxide or titania,is the naturally occurring oxide of titanium,chemical formula TiO 2.When used as a pigment,it is called titanium white,Pigment White 6 (PW6),or CI 77891.Generally,it is sourced from ilmenite,rutile and anatase.It has a wide range of applications,including paint,sunscreen and food coloring.Process ChartThe Manufacturing Plant at KMML comprises the Mineral Separation (MS) Unit and the Titanium dioxide Pigment (TP) Unit.The MS Unit is where the separation of Ilmenite,Rutile,Leucoxone,Monazite,Silliminite etc from the beach sand takes place,through the various stages in the Wet Concentration Plant,Dryer Plant,Dry Mill,Rutile &amp; Zircon Recovery Plants.The MS Unit employs …
