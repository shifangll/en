## Enhancement of Critical Current Density in Graphite. IOPscience
(Received 10 August 2004).Graphite doped MgB2 xCx (x 二 0.00,0.05,0.10) wires were fabricated via the in situ powder in tube method in ёowing argon by using low carbon steel tubes as the sheath materials.With the increase of graphite concentration,the amount of unreacted graphite in the core area increases,and&nbsp;.Properties of high density,recrystallized graphite The American.Physical and thermal properties are reported for several types ofgraphite,including National Carbon.Company grades ATJ and ZT,pyrolytic and single crystal graphite.Gráphites compañd cover a density range of 1.73 to 2.26 glcne&#39; The effects of temperature (range 0 3000&#39;C) on properties are discussed.Th e high density&nbsp;.
