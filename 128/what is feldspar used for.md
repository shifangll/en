## Division of Geology and Mineral Resources Feldspar
Feldspar is one of the most abundant minerals in the earth's crust.The feldspars include a range of compositions with a general chemical formula of xAl(Al,Si) 3 O 8 where x can be sodium (Na) and or calcium (Ca) and or potassium (K).They are primarily used in glass and ceramics making.Orthoclase: Pink granite,Mohs hardness and moonstoneOrthoclase is the feldspar mineral of pink granite,the #6 mineral of the Mohs hardness scale,and one of the two minerals that comprise Moonstone.
