## Ball mill
A ball mill,a type of grinder,is a cylindrical device used in grinding (or mixing) materials like ores,chemicals,ceramic raw materials and paints.Ball mills rotate around a horizontal axis,partially filled with the material to be ground plus the grinding medium.Different materials are used as media,including ceramic balls,flint pebbles andExperimental investigations and modelling of the ball.&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;Abstract.Planetary ball mills feature attractive properties,like the possibility of dry or wet operation,straightforward handling,cleanability and moderate costs.Consequently they are very well suited for lab scale process development in diverse industries,including pharmaceuticals and new materials.
