## Raw materials for cement manufacturing
The second important raw material for cement production is clay.The main component of clay is formed by hydrous aluminium silicates.The chemical composition of clay may vary from those close to the pure clay,to that containing a significant amount of admixtures as iron hydroxide,iron sulfide,sand,calcium carbonate,etc.Clay is used as an argillaceous component of raw mix.Cement Manufacturing process and Equipment listThe raw material mix is fed to a kiln where pyro processing takes place.Preheaters : To save energy,modern cement plants preheat the materials before they enter the kiln rising more than 200feet,hot exit gases from the kiln heat the raw materials.3 or more preheaters are installed to raise the temperature of the material before it enters the kiln.
