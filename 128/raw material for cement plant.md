## Proposal for Reducing Emissions of SOx in Cement Plants
Proposal for Reducing Emissions of SOx in Cement Plants.The raw materials used in cement production are.In the past the cement plants depends on to burn.raw material used for mini cement plantCement Production Line,Cement Plant,Cement … Cement production line: Cement making plant is used in cement raw materials crushing plant.Limestone crushing: Limestone is the main raw material for cement making,but natural limestone is usually big therefore,we use cement limestone crusher to crush them into small particles.

## Cement Manufacturing Process NPC
3 Jul 2017.Cement uses raw materials that cover calcium,iron and aluminum.Such raw materials are limestone,shale and sand.Limestone is for calcium.It is combined with much smaller proportions of dolerite,sand,and aluminium.Sand &amp; clay fulfil the need of silicon,iron and aluminum.Generally cement plants&nbsp;.Cement USGSCertain raw materials for cement production have depletion allowances.the mercury limits were expected to make it difficult for cement plants to continue to burn
