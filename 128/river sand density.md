## What is the density of sand? Quora
Answer (1 of 6): It depends on several factors First,what's the density of the minerals that make up the sand in question Keep in mind that Sand is a name refering to how big the grains are and not what they are made of Though most sand is made either of Quartz (quartz density 265 g cm³) or.1 Cubic meter River & M sand weight in kg & ton Civil SirPeople have choice to purchase river sand for their construction work And they were want to know weight of 1 cubic metre of river sand Average density of River sand is 1650 kg m3,it means 1650 kg river sand occupy 1 cubic metre of space or container,1 cubic meter of River sand weight = 1650kg,so 1650kg is weight of 1 cubic meter of river sand
