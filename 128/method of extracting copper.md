Zinc ores and extraction 2.How we extract zinc from its ores.Stage 1 The low concentrations of the zinc sulphide mineral in most zinc ores mean that the ore must first be concentrated before extracting the metal The zinc blende (sphalerite: zinc sulphide)is first crushed to powder and then treated by froth flotation (that process is described in the copper unit.It is used in the extraction.Methods of Extraction Portuguese Copper Alembic Stills.Methods of Extraction. Split Top Rotating Column Copper Alembic Stills.Carbon dioxide extraction: this is a very recent method of extraction using lower temperatures than that of distillation and is therefore less aggressive for the plants.The plant material is placed in a closed stainless steel tank and injected with carbon dioxide.
