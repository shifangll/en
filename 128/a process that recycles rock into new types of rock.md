## How Is Rock Continually Recycled in the Rock Cycle.
Like a giant recycling machine,Earth constantly creates rocks,breaks them down and converts them into new types of rock.This rock cycle occurs because of the way weather and other natural forces react with minerals above and below the Earth’s surface.The cycle never stops and it ensures that the planet never runs.The rock cycle — Science Learning HubAs part of the rock cycle,any rock can be changed into one of the other rock types or into a different form of themselves.For example,sedimentary rock can be broken down to form new sedimentary rock,or it may be changed into metamorphic rock.Material does not always go round in a neat sequence,but takes part in a whole network of processes.
