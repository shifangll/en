## Portland Cement Manufacturing Industrial Resources Council
Everyone is familiar with Portland cement.Mixed with water and aggregate,it forms the Portland cement concrete that is used in everything from sidewalks to bridges to skyscrapers.3.3 Raw Materials for Cement Manufacture3.3 Raw materials for cement manufacture.has now been rendered obsolete by the development of efficient dry grinding equipment,and all modern cement plants use the dry process.When it is ready to enter the kiln,the dry raw mix has 85% of the particles less than 90 £gm in size.About Cement > Cement Manufacture[ ]Mineral additions and SCMs are added to reduce the amount of clinker in cement.This in turn reduces the fuel,power,process emissions and raw materials associated with cement production.At the same time it creates a use for material considered to be a waste product of other industries.
