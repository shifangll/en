## US9676669B1 Method of producing sodium bentonite.
As per API specification for bentonite used in cements,the favorable bentonite properties should have: zero free water,lightweight cement system,and good rheological properties and controlled fluid loss (Grant,W.H.J.Rutledge,J.M.Gardner,C.A.“Quality of Bentonite and Its Effects on Cement Slurry Performance” SPE Production.Producing protein intercalated bentonite — Equilibrium.Protein intercalated bentonite was produced using gelatin with calcium (CaBt),sodium (NaBt) and octadecylamine modified bentonite (amine Bt).Adsorption isotherms and rates were investigated from pH 3 to pH 9 and 4 to 20 mg ml initial gelatin concentrations using 3 g of adsorbent loading per 100 ml solution.
