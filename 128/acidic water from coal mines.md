## What is Acid Mine Drainage
Acid Mine Drainage (AMD) is currently the main pollutant of surface water in the mid Atlantic.mainly from abandoned coal mines and currently active mining.How can acid mine drainage be treated?Treatment of AMD: Acid mine drainage sometimes forms when certain minerals in the soil and rocks around mines are exposed to weathering processes during miningThese exposed minerals release their contents into creeks causing them to become acidic This kind of pollution damages aquatic life and makes the water useless or harmful for others who depend on it for recreation or drinking water
