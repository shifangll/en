## The Concrete Curing Process Brighthub Engineering
Curing is more than retaining moisture for a prolonged period on the concrete surface.Curing is the process that ensures that the concrete attains its desired strength.The strength of concrete is dependent on the crystal growth within the concrete matrix.These crystals grow due to hydration that is a reaction between the water and Portland cement.
