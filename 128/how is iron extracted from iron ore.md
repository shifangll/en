## How Is Iron Extracted From the Earth? Reference
Iron ores in the form of hematite (ferrous oxide) and magnetite are removed from the earth through mining The use of heavy mining equipment is necessary to dig out large pits in an area with a large deposit of iron ore; however,because iron does not occur naturally,it is necessary to use a blast furnace to separate or refine iron from the other substances in the iron oreIron WikipediaIron ore is then treated with these gases in a furnace,producing solid sponge iron: Fe 2 O 3 + CO + 2 H 2 → 2 Fe + CO 2 + 2 H 2 O Silica is removed by adding a limestone flux as described above Thermite Iron is a byproduct of burning a mixture of aluminium powder and rust powder Fe 2 O 3 + 2 Al.
