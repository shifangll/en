## Extraction Process of Aluminium from Bauxite Ore 911 Metallurgist
17 Mar 2017.Aluminum is the most abundant metal in the earth&#39;s crust and is a constituent of many minerals.However,the material which is highest in aluminum and most free from objectionable impurities is bauxite which,therefore,is practically the only source of the metal under present processes.Bauxite is the&nbsp;.Leaching kinetics of gibbsitic bauxite with sodium hydroxidehydroxide are presented.The effect of ore particle size,sodium hydroxide concentration and.The Bayer process is used for refining bauxite to smelting grade.

## BAYER PROCESS
Bayer process is the process of refining alumina from bauxite (aluminum ore containing 30 .50% of hydrated aluminum oxide).Prior to the Bayer process bauxite is crushed and ground in mills to fine particles (max.size.0.06” 1.5mm).is sodium oxide (Na2O) concentration of which may vary between 300 to 7000 ppm.Leaching Kinetics of Bauxite in Hydrochloric Acid: Mineral.The process consists of the following steps: calcination of bauxite,leaching of calcined bauxite in hydrochloric acid,filtration of residue,crystallization of A1C13.6.The acid concentration has a marked effect on leaching kinetics of bauxite and the leaching time decreases substantially as the concentration of acid increases.
