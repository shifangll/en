## 
The concrete curing process involves a reaction between Portland cement and water helping on releasing heat from the concrete at a desired and controlled rate.What is the reason behind the curing of concrete? QuoraCuring is necessary because : * Concrete strength depends on the growth of crystals within the matrix of the concrete.These crystals grow from a reaction between Portland cement and water—a reaction known as hydration.

## The Physics and Chemistry of Concrete
• Goal is to reduce number of physical concrete tests,thus expediting R&D process.chemical reactions • changes material sets as easily as changing lines in a database.number of “cells” of solute and water • In any time step,each cell can execute aClinker: reactions in the kiln.Water evaporation In wet process kilns.perhaps not the best way to get a clear picture of a complex process like cement.

## Basics foundations
Cement and water are the two ingredients that chemically react; the gravel and sand As the reactions proceed,the products of the cement hydration processchemical reaction process is called.components of cement reacts with water and to form solid.permeation or chloride ingress due to pressure gradient.
