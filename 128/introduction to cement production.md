## CEMENT 101
&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;Introduction A cement is any substance which binds together other materials by a combination of chemical processes known collectively as setting.1 Cements are dry powders and should not be confused with concretes or mortars,but they are an important constituent of both of these materials,in which they act as the 'glue' that gives strength to structures.ConcreteConcrete is strong in compression,as the aggregate efficiently carries the compression load.However,it is weak in tension as the cement holding the aggregate in place can crack,allowing the structure to fail.Reinforced concrete adds either steel reinforcing bars,steel fibers,aramid fibers,carbon fibers,glass fibers,or plastic fibers to carry tensile loads.
