## How sand is made material,manufacture,making,history.
The Manufacturing Process The preparation of sand consists of five basic processes: natural decomposition,extraction,sorting,washing,and in some cases crushing.The first process,natural decomposition,usually takes millions of years.If the plant is located next to a sand dune or beach,the plant may process only sand.Patent US4813969 Process of manufacturing synthetic hair.1.In a process of manufacturing synthetic hair filaments for use in wigs and hair pieces the improvement comprising providing the surface of the individual synthetic polymer filaments with an increased diffuse light refraction characteristic by forming individual filaments essentially round in cross section without material differences in diameters thereof so that the surface is convex.
