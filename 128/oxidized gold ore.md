## Leaching Stubborn Oxidized Gold Ores That Contain Copper,
Jan 21,2016&#0183;&#32;This article is devoted to the leaching of gold from copper bearing oxidized stubborn gold ores in the Tarror deposit The high copper content of the ores makes it difficult to extract gold from them by direct cyanidation An analysis of the literature data indicated that ammoniacal leaching might be one solution to this problemA GOLD PLATINUM PALLADIUM LODE IN SOUTHERN,a few dollars in gold to the ton The ore bodies so far developed may be briefly characterized as oxidized copper shoots and gold platinum palladium shoots The copper ores consist largely of chrysocolla and colloidal complexes of chrysocolla and limonite; these ores are reported to carry only minor amounts of the precious metals
