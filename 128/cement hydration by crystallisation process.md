Superplasticizer adsorption on ettringite was determined under two different conditions: (a) addition of superplasticizer at the beginning of the crystallization process.This experiment simulates ettringite crystallization in a superplasticizer treated cement slurry; or (b) after completion of the hydration phase synthesis (2 h).Controlling Crystallization Pressure George Scherer&#39;s Materials.The goal of materials science is to understand how structure controls properties and how processing controls structure.Crystallization pressure arises when salts precipitate in the pores of stone or concrete.âHydration and Crystallization Pressure of Sodium Sulfate: a Critical Reviewâ,R.J.Flatt,G.W.Scherer,pp.29 34&nbsp;.

## Concrete: Scientific Principles
Hydration is a chemical reaction in which the major compounds in cement form chemical bonds with water.Details of the hydration process are explored in the next section.Once this occurs,the calcium hydroxide starts to crystallize.From nanocrystals to concrete components BASF CorporationChemically speaking,calcium silicate hydrate (CSH) and other compounds crystallize out of the cement during this process to form a compact artificial stone in.
