## Concrete: Scientific Principles
Hydration is a chemical reaction in which the major compounds in cement form chemical bonds with water.Details of the hydration process are explored in the next section.Once this occurs,the calcium hydroxide starts to crystallize.From nanocrystals to concrete components BASF CorporationChemically speaking,calcium silicate hydrate (CSH) and other compounds crystallize out of the cement during this process to form a compact artificial stone in.
