## How concrete is made
Raw Materials Structural concrete normally contains one part cement to two parts fine mineral aggregate to four parts coarse mineral aggregate,though these proportions are often varied to achieve the strength and flexibility required in a particular setting.Interlocking concrete pavers: The manufacturing process Tfor concrete pavers will depend on locally available materials,manufacturing equip ment requirements,and the desired final texture and quality of the paving unit.A low water cement ratio (usually between 0.27 and 0.40) is used to produce a no slump concrete with high strength and durability.The concrete mix normally con
