Dicalcium phosphate is the calcium phosphate with the formula CaHPO4 and its dihydrate The “di” prefix in the common name arises because the formation of the HPO42 anion involves the removal of two protons from phosphoric acid,H3PO4Use of monocalcium phosphate more beneficial than.2020 3 2&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Q: Is the use of monocalcium phosphate more beneficial than dicalcium phosphate in cattle feeds? (October 12,2009) A: When providing supplemental phosphorus,consider two major factors.First,whether the source of P is available biologically (i.e.readily absorbed).

## What Is Tricalcium Phosphate?
Tricalcium phosphate is a supplement in which calcium is bound to a phosphate molecule.Though dietary deficiencies of phosphorus are uncommon,phosphorus is an essential part of cell membranes.Di calcium phosphate by direct acidulation of phosphate,di calcium phosphate by direct acidulation of phosphate rock In general,when phosphate rock is treated with sulfuric acid,mono calcium phosphate or phosphoric acid is formed If less sulfuric acid is used,di calcium phosphate should be formed theoretically,however only mono calcium phosphate and undecomposed phos&#173; phate rock result in.
