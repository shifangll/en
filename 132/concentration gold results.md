The result shows that the effect of oxygen concentration curves in gas chamber presents two extrema due to the granularity change of coal samples.If the granularity mesh value is between 20～100,the oxygen concentration gradient in gas chamber increases with coal granularity increasing,but they have not linear relation each other.Gravity Concentration GekkoThe gravity concentration separation process gets more complex as the specific gravities between the valuable mineral and the gangue get closer.For example,complex gold in a sulphide complex of pyrite,must isolate a specific gravity of 19.3 for gold from 5.2 for pyrite.
