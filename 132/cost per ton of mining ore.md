Consider this example of the simple economics that today&#39s higher metal prices offer: Using ballpark numbers for heap leach projects from the 1990s,a typical cost would be something in the range of $3 per ton to mine and process ore,and $1.50 to dig and dispose of waste.We can use as an example a low grade ore&nbspCost of Stoping for Underground Mining5&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Low cost per ton may involve loss of ore or excessive dilution with waste and a low cost per ton method may not,therefore,be the most economical one in a given instance.Table 38,giving stoping costs per ton of ore mined,should be considered with the foregoing important fact in mind.
