Gold CIL &amp; CIP Gold Leaching Process Explained CCD.Cyanide is a lixiviant,or reagent that is used to leach,often in tanks,gold from a solid matrix and form a gold cyanide complex.The gold cyanide complex is then extracted from the pulp or slurry by adsorption onto activated carbon.CIL stands for …FARC,BACRIM Dividing Gold Profits in Colombia Province: Police.14 Mar 2014.While the FARC,in particular,have long charged fees to local miners to work in areas they control,they have increasingly grown to control the extraction process itself.The Urabeños are also known to control illegal gold mining operations,in both the northwest and northeast of the Antioquia department&nbsp;.
