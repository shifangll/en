## Why does a pop can implode if you boil some water in it and then flip.
Now by pouring cold water on the outside,the pressure of the water that was at 1 bar will now decrease.The air pressure is actually pretty high!.Actually,if you seal the can and wait,it will implode at room temperature.a partial vacuum of 10lbs would create 300lbs of force on the can more than enough to crush it.i EFFECT OF HIGH PRESSURE HOMOGENIZATION METUMay 6,2015.High pressure homogenization (microfluidization) is a non thermal process.High Shear Homogenization (Silent Crusher) and Enzyme Treatment.time temperatures,water availability,and intensity of daylight (Wang &amp; Camp.phenolic content of commercial strawberry juice was lower than others.
