## What is the composition of white cast iron?
Scientifically,White cast iron usually contains 1.8 % 3.6 % C,0.5 % 1.9 % Si and 1 % 2 % manganese (Mn).Its fracture surface is white,therefore known as white cast iron.It is generally cast as soft and strong.Cast iron is very useful and.Sand WikipediaSand is a granular material composed of finely divided rock and mineral particl Sand has various compositions but is defined by its grain size Sand grains are smaller than gravel and coarser than siltSand can also refer to a textural class of soil or soil type; ie,a soil containing more than 85 percent sand sized particles by mass The composition of sand varies,

## 2.The composition of clay materials Geological Society
Clay materials are composed of solid,liquid and vapour phases.The solid phases are of mineral and organic phases that make up the framework of the clay materials.The mineralogy can be broadly subdivided into the clay and nonclay minerals,including poorly crystalline,socalled 'amorphous' inorganic phases.By definition,minerals are crystalline solids with wellordered crystalGrey Cast Iron Composition Sand Casting,Investment,Grey Cast Iron Composition and Property Grey Cast Iron (Gray iron) is so called because of the colour of the fracture face It contains 15 43% carbon and 03 5% silicon plus manganese,sulphur and phosphorus It is brittle with low tensile strength,but is easy to cast The all data in this documents is referred to Chinese standard of GB T.

the iron can be removed simply,by aerating the water and filtering it through sand and gravel The sand and gravel used in the filters will need to be cleaned periodically Similar problems arise when water has excessive manganese concentrations (above 01 mg l,the WHO guideline value),but again the water can be treated by aeration.Advances in Civil Engineering Hindawi Publishing Corporation201122&ensp&#0183&enspAdvances in Civil Engineering is a peerreviewed,Open Access journal that publishes original research articles as well as review articles in all areas of civil engineering.The journal welcomes submissions across a range of disciplines,and publishes both theoretical and practical studies.
