## The Types of Coal: Composition,Usage,and Energy Value
 · All types of coal contain fixed carbon,which provides stored energy and varying amounts of moisture,ash,volatile matter,mercury,and sulfur.Because the physical properties and coal quality vary widely,coal fired power plants …Coal explained U.S.Energy Information Administration (EIA)Types of coal.Coal is classified into four main types,or ranks: anthracite,bituminous,subbituminous,and lignite.The ranking depends on the types and amounts of carbon the coal contains and on the amount of heat energy the coal can produce.The rank of a coal deposit is determined by the amount of pressure and heat that acted on the plants.
