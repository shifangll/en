1 Jan 2002 Most solar cells are made of silicon,which starts out as sand.The sand itself is cheap.It&#39;s the making into silicon that isn&#39;t.Not yet,anyway.Sand to Solar Energy Panel! Solar ChoiceThat’s right! Your solar energy panel is primarily made from silicon,an element which is found in sand.Well how does it happen? The key steps in the process are as follows: Silicon refinement This is where the sand gets taken from the picture above refined and melted into pure silicon blocks.
