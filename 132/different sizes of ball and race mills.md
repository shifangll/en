## Types and Characteristics of End Mills
For mold applications,radius tools can remove more material faster than ball ends.Typically can remove material up to three times the rate of conventional end mills with different types available to achieve the desired finish on the material.Melin offers roughers in Coarse Pitch,Fine Pitch,Rougher Finisher,and 3 Flute for Aluminum styles.Single End Teeth on one end of the cutter.Optimization of mill performance by using SAIMMdifferent liner designs at different mill speed but with constant filling degree (30%).Indeed,as explained previously,at a mill stop,the measurement of ball charge filling degree could be undertaken and will provide the static media charge angle (βstatic = 143°).An online measurement of the similar angle (βdynamic),when the mill is running,provides information about the dynamics of.
