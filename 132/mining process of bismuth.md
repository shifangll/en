2020 2 22&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Removal of arsenic,antimony and bismuth from copper may take place in the smelting operations by scorification,volatilization,or,under special treatment,by processes of concentration.Owing to the great variety of materials that are treated in economical metallurgy,it is rarely possible to obtain exact weights from any particular operation.Roadmap BismuthWith Bismuth now having most of the May 2017 Roadmap implemented,it is time to declare new goals based on the longterm vision of constant development and improvements.Besides the described achievements,the Bismuth core code has also been strengthened,block security has been greatly increased with the recent successful hard forks.

## Antamina Copper
The Antamina copper zinc mine is located in the Andes Mountains of Peru,approximately 285km north of Lima in the Department of Ancash.The elevation of the mine is 4,300m above sea level.The mine was brought into production by a joint venture comprising the Canadian companies,Noranda Inc (33.75%) and TeckCominco Ltd.(22.5%),Australian UK.Fortune Minerals Announces Successful Production of 99.99%.¬†¬∑ Fortune previously demonstrated the production of a minimum 99% bismuth cathode powder product.High purity metal ingots can now be poured after smelting this powder in ‚Ä¶

## Bismuth resources,reserves and production
The world reserves of bismuth containing ore stands at 320,000 tonnes and the reserve base is estimated to be 680,000 tonnes.The mined bismuth content production in 2013 can be seen in the table below.In 2013,worldwide total bismuth mining production was 7,600 tonnes,falling 0.7% (600 tonnes) compared with last year‚Äôs figure of 8,200 tonnes.LeadOften we hear that copper concentrates have contaminants which affect the incomes to be obtained by commercialization.Well,one of the worst contaminant is bismuth because is difficult to remove during smelting process and the metallic copper to be obtained at the end of the process will be brittle and consequently its mechanical properties will be very bad.Ergo,the objective is focused to.
