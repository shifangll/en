## High energy ball milling process for nanomaterial synthesis
(a) At the initial stage of ball milling,the powder particles are flattened by the compressive forces due to the collision of the balls.Micro forging leads to changes in the shapes of individual particles,or cluster of particles being impacted repeatedly by the milling balls with high kinetic energy.However,such deformation of the&nbsp;.Nano Sizing: Wet versus Dry Grinding Custom Processing ServicesNano Sizing Via Wet or Dry Grinding nano sizing.Nano sized particles are desirable in many industries,from active pharmaceuticals and pigments to technical.
