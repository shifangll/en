## Calcium carbonate weight loss when heated? Yahoo Answers
Sep 18,2008&#0183;&#32;I did a small experiment in class,where we looked for weight loss that occured when heating Calcium Carbonate due to the release of Carbon Dioxide The weight loss that I had was not enough of what was expected,and now when I have to write up my experiment I have to give several reasons of why the mass loss was below of what was expectedMechano chemical surface modification of calcium carbonate.Mechanical energy released during stirred grinding of calcium carbonate.surface modification of calcium carbonate by.modification of calcium carbonate.
