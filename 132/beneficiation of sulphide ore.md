## Copper extraction Wikipedia
Copper extraction refers to the methods used to obtain copper from its ores.The conversion of copper consists of a series of physical and electrochemical processes.Methods have evolved and vary with country depending on the ore source,local environmental regulations,and other factors.Froth flotation WikipediaFroth flotation is a process for selectively separating hydrophobic materials from hydrophilic.The first successful commercial flotation process for mineral sulphides was invented.In 1897,the Elmore brothers installed the world&#39;s first industrial size commercial flotation process for mineral beneficiation at the Glasdir mine.
