## 20.1 Metal Deposits Physical Geology
Mining and Mineral Processing.Metal deposits are mined in a variety of different ways depending on their depth,shape,size,and grade.Relatively large deposits that are quite close to the surface and somewhat regular in shape are mined using open pit mine methods (Figure 20.1).Creating a giant hole in the ground is generally cheaper than making an underground mine,but it is also less.
