## Developments in the physical separation of iron ore,
Jan 01,2015&#0183;&#32;The ore is mainly composed of magnetite,hematite,martite,and quartz It is very difficult to produce a high quality iron ore concentrate by magnetic separation alone for this type of iron ore The ore is first ground using ball mills down to about 90% 75 μmHow to Tell if the Rock You Found Might Be a Meteorite: 11,Jul 05,2021&#0183;&#32;2 Use a magnet to see whether the rock is magnetic Nearly all meteorites are at least somewhat magnetic,even if only weakly This is due to the high concentration in most meteorites of iron and nickel,which are magnetic If a magnet is not attracted to,
