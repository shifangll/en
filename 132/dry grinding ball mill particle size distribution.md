## Cement grinding Vertical roller mills versus ball mills
2017 11 7&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;High circulation factors invariably lead to steep particle size distribution curves,if the separation process is efficient.It has therefore been necessary to adapt special measures to reduce the inclination of the particle size distribution curve,in order to get a cement quality that is similar to the quality of cement ground in a ball mill.A Kinetic Study of Micronization Grinding of Dry Mica …This paper presents results of the research of micronization grinding of dry mica in a planetary ball mill.Investigation was conducted in order to improve the quality and to obtain clearly defined properties and characteristics of mica powder.The micronization grinding of dry mica was performed in four time periods: 30,60,120,and 360 minutes.
