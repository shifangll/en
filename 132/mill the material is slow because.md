## The Skinny on End Mills Make:
&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;CNC machining is a subtractive process that uses rotational cutting tools called ‚Äúend mills‚Äù to remove material.An end mill,while similar in appearance to a drill bit,is far more versatile.However,in practice the terms ‚Äúbit‚Äù and ‚ÄCast ironCast iron's properties are changed by adding various alloying elements,or alloyants.Next to carbon,silicon is the most important alloyant because it forces carbon out of solution.A low percentage of silicon allows carbon to remain in solution forming iron carbide and the production of white cast iron.
