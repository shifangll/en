## Calcium sulfate Wikipedia
The calcium sulfate hydrates are used as a coagulant in products such as tofu Up to the 1970s,commercial quantities of sulfuric acid were produced in Whitehaven (Cumbria,UK) from anhydrous calcium sulfateUpon being mixed with shale or marl,and roasted,the sulfate liberates sulfur trioxide gas,a precursor in sulfuric acid production,the reaction,PHOSPHOGYPSUM: A Review of the Florida,Any fuel can be used to heat the gypsum to reaction temperature,and over the years almost every common fuel has been used (3) A carbon source,a mixture of natural gypsum and phosphogypsum,lime and sulphuric ac
