 · RE: Aggregate Base Density Data BigH (Geotechnical) 28 May 05 14:03 JedClampett sorry,but we have compacted crushed stone coming in at over 150pcf.Why? Our specific gravity is 3.0.I agree with you.M076 can look in tables of swell shrink on variouis materials from bank to in truck to in place.I have a chart but how to put it on here?density of crushed granite stones Crusher ….Material,lbs. cu.yd.tons cu.density of 10mm.with a solid stone of granite that has a weight of 165 lbs.what is the density of crushed granite stone.

## Calculating gravel tonnage,cubes,and sand and earth.
Real life stone,gravel and sand densities (weight volume) vary widely: The local quarry or supplier which you elect to use should be able to provide the densities (tons cubic yard) of their unique gravel,which they are quoting to you.The densities of local mediums (gravels,crushed stone,aggregates,sands,etc) will vary from one quarry to the next.The densities (pounds per square.BULK MATERIAL DENSITY TABLE Tapco IncBULK MATERIAL DENSITY TABLE Material Description.Density # Ft.Ebonite,Crushed 65 70 Epsom Salts 40 50.Granite,Broken 95 100 Granite.
