## What is the principle of flotation Answers
Law of Flotation was discovered by Archimedes in 212 BCNo one knows exactly what year the law of flotation was discovered The law of flotation is an application of Archimedes' principleCopper beneficiation process Yantai Jinpeng Mining,Copper ore divides into ore sulfide,ore oxide and mixing ore according to its oxide rate The main process for copper ore is flotation,for refractory mixed copper ore and refractory oxide ore,normally use hydrometallurgy process It is a high technological enterprise that integrated research,manufacture,sales and service The company has multiple subsidiaries such as,
