Rolling chatter is the result of interactions between the rolling process and the mill structure,as well as between consecutive stands on a tandem mill.Based on two friction models which are widely employed in industry,the rolling process model is conducted in this research by considering the material strain hardening effect and the work roll flattening effect.Mixing millsThe two rolls of the rolling mill rotate in the opposite direction.For the purpose of mixing,one roll runs faster than the other one (friction).Therefore,shearing forces act on the rubber in t
