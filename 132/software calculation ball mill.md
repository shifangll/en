of the Bond ball mill grindability test.For all model based methods,a reliable method to calculate mill power draw for a given mill is required for the calculation of power draw.Morrell (1996) proposed a mathematical model for autogenous,semi autogenous and ball mills which is based on the motion of grinding charge inside the mill.Correlations for the Grindability of the Ball Mill As a. CiteSeerXFinally the calculated values of the fines in terms of the grindability of the mill obtained through the correlations by.balls,time of grinding,particle density and speed of the ball mill (rpm) have been considered.computer simulation program.
