## a guidebook to particle size analysis Horiba
Separation steps such as screening,filtering,cyclones,etc.may be monitored by measuring particle size before and after the process.Particle size.Cement particle size influences hydration rate &amp; strength.The size and shape distribution.particles flow randomly through the light beam,producing a distribution of sizes.
