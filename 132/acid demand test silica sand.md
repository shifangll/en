## Acid Demand Value (ADV) Test Kit Simpson Technologies
The Acid Demand Value (ADV) Test measures the amount of basic material present in the sand that is soluble in a dilute acid solution.Since the reaction which cures the resin in many chemical binder systems is acid alyzed,and since the acid is very mild,the presence of the basic material which can neutralize this weak acid will retard the curing reaction.Acid demand values.Archives EA JournalsPhysico chemical analysis shows a moderate pH value of 7.03 signifying high basic oxides content in the silica sand samples.Acid Demand Value (ADV) test.
