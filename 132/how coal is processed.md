## How is coal processed? Socratic
Most coal mines that mine coal for power plants simply dig it up and send it to the power plant for burning.Very little processing.Some times a mine might blend low grade coal with higher grade coal to ensure a constant feedstock quality.What is coal? And how is it extracted and processed.2007 6 3&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;After coal comes out of the ground,it typically goes on a conveyor belt to a preparation plant that is located at the mining site.The plant cleans and processes coal to remove dirt,rock,ash,sulfur,and other unwanted materials,increasing the heating value of the coal.Coal reserves are beds of coal still in the ground waiting to be mined.
