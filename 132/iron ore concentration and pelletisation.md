## Iron Ore Pellets and Pelletization Process IspatGuru
Iron Ore Pellets and Pelletization Process.Pelletizing of iron ore was started in the 1950s to facilitate the utilization of finely ground iron ore concentrates in steel production.For the pelletizing of iron ore there are two main types of processes namely,the straight travelling grate (STG) process andIron Ore and Pellets ValeVale is the world&#39;s leading producer of iron ore and pellets.the powder that is generated during the ore extraction process,once considered waste.In addition,we have a pelletizing plant in Oman and stakes in joint ventures in China that.
