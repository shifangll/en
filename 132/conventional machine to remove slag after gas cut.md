## Austempering
nbsp 0183 32 Austempering is heat treatment that is applied to ferrous metals most notably steel and ductile iron In steel it produces a bainite microstructure whereas in cast irons it produces a structure of acicular ferrite and high carbon stabilized austenite known as ausferrite It is primarily used to improve mechanical properties or reducehow to soften plasma cut steel&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;I'm currently cutting a lot of 3 4&quot; plasma cut plate.Just use a 4&quot; grinder to knock the slag off.If possible,conventional mill deep enough that you're &quot;scooping&quot; out the hard edges.Don't try to climb mill or take light cuts.You'll be rubbing too much against the slag and hard steel and ruining cutters quickly.
