## calculate steel weight in the rcc works
Step 5 Calculate weight of steel rod Now let us assume the 1% of steel has used in the concrete Then,1 % of concrete volume becomes 01 meter cube of steel Therefore,Weight of steel rod = volume x density = 01 x 7850 = 785 kg At last you can add water charges which is about 15% of total cost of the concrete and 10% contractors chargLab ball mill media charge calculation Consuol Mining,The ball mill is a tumbling mill that uses steel balls as the grinding media The length of the cylindrical shell is usually 1 15 times the shell diameter (Figure 811 ) The feed can be dry,with less than 3% moisture to minimize ball coating,or slurry containing 20 40% water by weight
