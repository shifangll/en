ed with plansifters.The milling process aims to grind the endosperm into finer particles of flour and semolina,while the coating and the seed particles must remain in large sizes to be separated by sifting,[2].In gristing passages,milling rollers with fluted surface are used,and in milling passages,rollers with smooth surface&nbsp;.Grinding MillsGinding media (25 mm or less) inside the mill are agitated or rotated by the stirrer,which typically comprises a central shaft to which are attached screws,pins or discs of various designs.Stirred mills find application in regrinding,fine (15 40 &#181;m) and ultra fine (&lt;15 &#181;m) grinding.
