## Basic Introduction of Various Types of Milling Cutters.
&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;The word “end mill” is generally use to refer flat bottom cutters.The basic difference between drill bit and end mill cutter is that the drill bit can cut only in axial direction but this cutter can cut in all directions.Ball Nose Cutter is manufactured from qualitative carbide rods.As the name implies this cutter has ball like shape.Ball millA ball mill,a type of grinder,is a cylindrical device used in grinding (or mixing) materials like ores,chemicals,ceramic raw materials and paints.Ball mills rotate around a horizontal axis,partially filled with the material to be ground plus the grinding medium.Different materials are used as media,including ceramic balls,flint pebbles and stainless steel balls.
