The modulus of subgrade reaction is obtained from the subgrade and subbase M R values and the subbase thickness through a conversion process that transforms the actual multilayer pavement structure into an equivalent three layer structure consisting of the PCC slab,base,and an effective dynamic k,as shown in Figure 5 29Modulus of Subgrade Reaction Geo Hydro EngineersThe magnitude of (k) typically ranges from about 100 to 250 pci,sometimes higher,depending on the subgrade materials and conditions.Additionally,the modulus of subgrade reaction used for design (effective modulus of subgrade reaction) can be enhanced by using a crushed stone course (untreated or cemented).
