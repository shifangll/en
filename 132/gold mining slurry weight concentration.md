## What is the role of cyanide in mining MiningFacts
Cyanide is a naturally occurring chemical that is found in low concentrations.It has been used by the mining industry to separate gold and silver particles from ore for.The pH of the resulting slurry is raised by adding lime or another alkali to.ore components are of similar density or when the concentration of gold is low.Gold Mineral Fact Sheets Australian Mines AtlasIt has a density nearly twice that of lead,is a good conductor of electricity and heat and is so.Liberated gold is concentrated in alluvial (placer) deposits.which dissolves gold and forms a slurry of gold bearing solution and barren solids.

## gold specific gravity mathematical solution
Gold Mining Process Development Denver Mineral Engineers Gravity concentration processes rely on the principal that gold contained within an ore body is higher in specific gravity than the host rocks that contain the gold Elemental gold has a specific gravity of 193,and typical ore has a specific gravity of about 26Calculating Physical Properties Of Slurries Cheresources,Mar 15,2013&#0183;&#32;Since the slurry consists of solid particles suspended in a liquid,the properties of a slurry mixture will depend upon those of the constituents The density of slurry can be calculated from the following equation: ρ m = 100 (C w ρ s) + [(100 C w) ρ L] where: ρ m =density of slurry mixture,kg m 3 C w = solids concentration by weight,%
