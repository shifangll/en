## Compressive strength prediction of Portland cement.
Compressive strength prediction of Portland cement concrete with age using a new modelWhat is the effect of coarse aggregate size in compressive.When we design mix the concrete,its target strength is much less than the compressive strength of the aggregates used in the formation.It can also be clearly seen in the mix design procedure that greater the maximum size of coarse aggregate used,less is the cement required to achieve the target strength.So,undoubtedly,greater the maximum.

## Compressive Strength of Concrete Cube Test,Procedure.
Compressive strength of concrete cube test provides an idea about all the characteristics of concrete.By this single test one judge that whether Concreting has been done properly or not.Concrete compressive strength for general construction varies from 15 MPa (2200 psi) to 30 MPa (4400 psi) and higher in commercial and industrial structures.Relation Between Compressive and Tensile Strength of …The compressive strength obtained from such tests is known as the cylinder strength fc' and this term is mainly used in design purposes.Test for tensile strength The tensile strength of concrete can be measured by radically different tests,namely flexure,direct tension and splitting,and the resulting values of strength are not the same.

## Properties of concrete Wikipedia
In very high strength concrete mixtures (greater than 70 MPa) the crushing strength of the aggregate can be a limiting factor to the ultimate compressive strength In lean concretes (with a high water cement ratio) the crushing strength of the aggregates is not so significant
