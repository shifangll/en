During contour milling we recommend a lateral infeed of approx.25 % of the end mill diameter while applying 100 % immersion depth.The immersion depth is conditional to the milling motor,the structure and the stability of the machine.This means a reduction of.The Pulp and Paper Making ProcessesWood received at a pulp mill may be in several different forms,depending on the pulping process and the origin of the raw material It maybe received as bolts (short logs) of roundwood with the bark still attached,as chips about the size of a half dollar that may have been produced from sawmill or veneer mill waste or pre chipped from.
