## Ampère&#39;s Law: Magnetic Field Inside a Wire
Ampère&#39;s Law: Magnetic Field Inside a Wire.Consider a long,straight wire of radius R.The current is I distributed uniformly over the cross section.Physics equations Magnetic field calculations ,The equation says that the integral of the magnetic field around a loop ∂ is equal to the current through any surface spanning the loop,plus a term depending on the rate of change of the electric field through the surface This term,the second term on the right,is the displacement current
