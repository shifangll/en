## Cement slurry extenders PetroWiki
These materials,in general,decrease the density of cement slurries by one of three means.The pozzolanic and inert organic materials have a lower density than cement and can be used to partially replace cement,lowering the density of the solid material in the slurry.Supplementary Cementing MaterialsSupplementary cementing materials (SCMs) contribute to the properties of hardened concrete through hydraulic or pozzolanic activity.Typical examples are fly ashes,slag cement (ground,granulated blastfurnace slag),and silica fume.These can be used individually with portland or blended cement or in different combinations.
