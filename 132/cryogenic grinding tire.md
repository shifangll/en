## How to Melt Rubber Tires Sciencing
Whether obtained from cryogenic grinding or from pyrolisis,scrap rubber still contains impurities that make it unsuitable for molding directly into new tir However,tire manufacturers often use it as an additive,and recycled rubber is a common ingredient in rubberized asphalt,which is used to make new roadways,sidewalks and playground,Manufacturing of rubber running tracks from recycled,Cryogenic grinding refers to the grinding of scrap tires at temperatures near minus 80oC using liquid nitrogen or commercial refrigerants it is the first initiative for the region below the point where rubber ceases to behave as a flexible material and can be easily crushed and broken wetland establishment reduces soil compaction separation
