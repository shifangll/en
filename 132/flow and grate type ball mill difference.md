media,mill liner,grate and pulp lifter optimisation have allowed the mill to operate 1530% above design implemented which allowed the SAG mill to operate similarly to a large ball mill and achieve finer mill.indie that both ore types can be considered soft,and these results compare well with the results from the.overflow grate millThe grate discharge type of Ball Mill has a grate at the outlet of the shell and causes less excessive grinding,compared to the overflow type.Therefore,generally,it is best suited to grind materials up to the particle sizes ranging from 60 to 100 mesh.
