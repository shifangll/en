## Technical Resource Document Iron Extraction And Beneficiation Of.
1.4.1 Extraction Methods Iron is mined almost exclusively in surface operations.The most predominant surface mining *,methods used to extract iron ore are open pit and open cut methods.However,there is currently one operating underground iron mine,located in Missouri (five were in operation in Missouri in 1985).Iron Ore Mining ArtifactsIron ore mining methods vary by the type of ore being mined.There are four main types of iron ore deposits worked currently,depending on the mineralogy and geology of the ore deposits.These are magnetite,titanomagnetite,massive hematite and pisolitic ironstone deposits.
