## What is the difference between the cylinder and cube,
Answer (1 of 5): When you apply compressive stresses on the Cylindrical Specimen in CTM,due to its height ie 300mm,the slender effect causes the cylinder to bear comparatively lesser amount of stress,when compared to a Cube(150mm) causing the cylinder to get crushed(We say a specimen is crushed.Compressive strength WikipediaCompressive strength or compression strength is the capacity of a material or structure to.Compressive strength is often measured on a universal testing machine; these range from very small table top systems to ones with over 53 MN.This grade is nothing but the Compressive Strength of the concrete cube or cylinder.

## How can I interpret compressive strength of concrete at 28 days?
4) But at the end fo the 28 days,compressive strength was under the limit.In case the strength of control specimens like cubes fail to give the compressive strength.in some testing apparatus,chose a rate of loading and crush at 28 days.Cube tests and the uniaxial compressive strength of,The cube is undoubtedly the most convenient specimen to use when large numbers of crushing tests are required for concrete control purpos The cylinder,or prism,on the other hand can give a much better estimate of the uniaxial compressive strength of concrete

## A Simple Guide to Concrete Cube Testing QEM Solutions
crushed concrete cube Therefore using the method of testing using concrete cubes,the tested compressive strength should be compared to the second number Once the cubes have reached failure,the shape of the cube has been altered due to the compression The failure shape can indicate whether it’s a satisfactory unsatisfactory failure
