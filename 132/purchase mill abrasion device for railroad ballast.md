ABSTRACT This work is a comprehensive investigation to find to what extent simple laboratory tests e.g.Los Angeles abrasion and micro Deval might be suitable for predicting real railway ballast.ABRASION TESTS FOR RAILROAD BALLASTABRASION TESTS FOR RAILROAD BALLAST.Mechanical abrasion tests are an important basis for evaluating the suitability of rock use as railroad ballast.This paper considers three such tests: Los Angeles abrasion,the test primarily used by North American railroads ; Deval abrasion,the test primarily used by British Rail; and mill abrasion,a.

The unexpected results from these tests could be explained by the broader gradation of the abraded ballast.It has been shown that a wider range of particle sizes in a granular material increases the strength.It is likely that this holds true foLaboratory Evaluation of Naturally Abraded Ballast.The unexpected results from these tests could be explained by the broader gradation of the abraded ballast.It has been shown that a wider range of particle sizes in a granular material increases the strength.It is likely that this holds true for this particular ballast,despite the increased level of abrasion.
