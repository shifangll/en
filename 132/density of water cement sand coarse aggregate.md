To calculate proportion of cement,sand,coarse agrregate and water,It required.FA,and water cement ratio,type of exposure,Maximum size of aggregate etc.of one cement bag,3.15 specific gravity of cement and 10 unit weight of water.Standard Test Method for Bulk Density (“Unit Weight”) and,11 This test method covers the determination of bulk density (“unit weight”) of aggregate in a compacted or loose condition,and calculated voids between particles in fine,coarse,or mixed aggregates based on the same determination This test method is applicable to aggregates not exceeding 125 mm [5 in] in nominal maximum size
