## A Simulation Study of Laboratory Scale Ball and Vertical.
The aim of this study was to investigate the grindability of solid fossil fuels from a thermal power plant by using a vertical stirred mill and conventional ball mill.The solid fossil fuel sample was obtained from the Zonguldak Catalagzi thermal power plant in Turkey.Ball Mills Mineral Processing & MetallurgyWorking Principle & Operation.The apparent difference in capacities between grinding mills (listed as being the same size) is due to the fact that there is no uniform method of designating the size of a mill,for example: a 5′ x 5′ Ball Mill has a working diameter of 5′ inside the liners and has 20 per cent more capacity than all other ball mills designated as 5′ x 5′ where the.
