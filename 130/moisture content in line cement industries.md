## Cement clinker
Cement clinker is a solid material produced in the manufacture of Portland cement as an intermediary product.Clinker occurs as lumps or nodules,usually 3 millimetres (0.12 in) to 25 millimetres (0.98 in) in diameter.It is produced by sintering (fusing together without melting to the point of liquefaction) limestone and aluminosilicate materials such as clay during the cement kiln stage.Cement Production IEA ETSAPJun 3,2010.produced in a kiln system from calcareous (line,chalk or marl) and.When wet raw materials (moisture content over 20%) are available,the wet process can be.Cement Production The manufacture of cement is a.
