## Bauxite: The principal ore of aluminum. Geology
Bauxite Used for Aluminum Production Bauxite is the principal ore of aluminum.The first step in producing aluminum is to crush the bauxite and purify it using the Bayer Process.In the Bayer Process,the bauxite is washed in a hot solution of sodium hydroxide,which leaches aluminum from the bauxite.The aluminum is precipitated out of.Production of Aluminum Sulphate from Indigenous Bauxite without.H2804 and the acid quantity was of the stoichiometric requirement cf bauxite.The reaction temperature was adjusted at 120°C for a time period of 0.5 6.5 hrs.whereas the particle size of the ore was 120 mesh.It has been found that.70% conversion (f A120; with 97% purity can be achieved after 5 hrs.readion time at acid.
