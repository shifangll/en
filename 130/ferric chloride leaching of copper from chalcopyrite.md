## Copper leaching from chalcopyrite concentrates SpringerLink
Chalcopyrite (CuFeS2) is one of the most abundant copper bearing minerals,which accounts for approximately 70 percent of the world’s known copper reserv For more than 30 years,a significant number of processes have been developed to leach copper from chalcopyrite concentrat These processes recover copper via hydrometallurgical leaching of the copper component of chalcopyrite.Leaching of chalcopyrite concentrate with ferric chlorideIn this study the kinetic leaching characteristics of chalcopyrite concentrate from Cuba (32.3% Cu) were investigated with granularities 315 + 200 mu m as delivered.
