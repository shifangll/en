BASED DIRECT REDUCED IRON SHAFT FURNACE How it works: Instead of a carbon reductant such as coke,H 2 is used to reduce iron ore pellets to "direct reduced iron" (DRI,or sponge iron) The reaction takes place in a shaft furnace,a type of furnace that uses gas reductants to make DRI The operating temperature can be fairly low,around 800&#176;Ciron ore & taconite Michigan State UniversityAmerica’s iron industry began along the Atlantic seaboard during the colonial period Most of these iron foundries were small and produced iron of inconsistent quality These operations came and went rapidly Demand for iron in America was small and producers’ plants were too modest to realize the advantages associated with economies of scale
