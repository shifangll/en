## Leach Circuit Design Principles SRK Consulting
Agitator design is determined by whether the aim of the agitator is to simply keep the material suspended or the need for efficient introduction of air oxygen for the leach reaction.The technical aspects of designing the leach circuit fall within the overall project design activities,as shown in the diagram below.Mercury Retort Furnace Envirocare Pollution Control …EnviroCare’s Mercury Retort Furnace is designed to thermally vaporize water,mercury and zinc present in gold ore precipitates.The thermal energy required is provided by electrically heating the concentrate.By means of a vacuum,the mercury vapor is drawn through a water cooled condenser where the vapors become liquid and are collected and sold to the commercial market.
