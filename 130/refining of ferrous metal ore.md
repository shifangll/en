## Non ferrous metallurgical processing Lhoist Minerals and lime.
Lime is also important for the pyrometallurgical refining and smelting of several non ferrous metals.Base metal concentrate production by mineral flotation.Borates in Metallurgy and Gold Refinement Alloys.In the production of steel and non ferrous metals,borates act as a flux during smelting.In this capacity,they are used to dissolve metallic oxide impurities,which are then removed with the slag.Borates are also used in the process of preparing bauxite ore for aluminum,as well as in refining gold and silver.
