## Precipitated Calcium Carbonate Multifunctional …
Production of Precipitated Calcium Carbonate Precipitated calcium carbonate is produced using the most economic process existing today.Limestone is converted into calcium oxide and carbon dioxide by means of calcination at temperatures in excess of 900&#176;C.To ensure a high level of purity,the calcination process is carried out using natural gas.Anticaking agent WikipediaAn anticaking agent is an additive placed in powdered or granulated materials,such as table salt or confectioneries,to prevent the formation of lumps and for easing packaging,transport,flowability,and consumption Caking mechanisms depend on the nature of the material Crystalline solids often cake by formation of liquid bridge and subsequent fusion of microcrystals
