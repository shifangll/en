Ball mill Wikipedia A ball mill is a type of grinder used to grind and blend materials for use in mineral dressing in speeds between the balls and grinding jars produces an interaction between frictional and impact forces,which releases high dynamic energiOpen Access Journal Journal of Sustainable Research in.may cause operational problems in ball mill structure that can lead to resonance and even to failure if any of the natural frequencies of the ball mill structure coincide with the operating frequency of the ball mill [5].Several research on dynamic analysis of the ball mill have been conducted using ﬁnite element analysis.
