## Practical reduction of manganese oxide. Allied Academies
Reduction of manganese oxides is considered in two steps.The first step is the reduction of oxygen rich oxides to MnO and the second one is the reduction of Mn to metallic manganese.Reduction starts with the transformation of MnO 2 into MnO 3 and Mn 2 O 3 into MnO 4 at temperatures over 450°C,then theseThe mechanism on reducing manganese oxide ore with.Manganese oxide (MnO) will further react with redundant sulfur to form MnS and MnSO 4.(2) During the reductive roasting process,MnSO 4 as well as gaseous SO 2 were simultaneously generated.Manganese sulfate was mainly derived from the reduction of manganese oxides by sulfur.
