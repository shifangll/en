## strength behaviour of foundry sand on modified high strength concrete
Abstract.Metal foundries use a large amount of sand as part of the metal casting process.Foundry industries generally recycle and reuse the used foundry sand many times in casting process.When the sand can no longer be reused in the foundry,it is removed from the foundry and is termed as &quot;foundry waste sand.
