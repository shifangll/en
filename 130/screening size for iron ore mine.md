Jan 01,2015&#0183;&#32;Iron ore operations commonly employ one or more stages of crushing with screening stages incorporated to remove material meeting product size specifications as soon as possible Lump product (typically between 6 and 30 mm) attracts a premium price compared to fines product (typically less than 6 mm)(PDF) Screening and Sieve Analysis Ithuteng Khoza,Screening usually follows after comminution The aim of this experiment was to screen and sieve haematite ore and to study its particle size distribution The screening was done using an industrial screen and the sieving was done using laboratory Tyler siev The initial mass of the ore manually fed to the screen was 11965 kg
