## Cone Crushers
Cone crushers are used in AG and SAG grinding circuits to increase tonnage by effectively dealing with any pebble (critical size) build up problem.Normally,heavy duty short head crushers are employed to crush pebbles.Power and crusher cavity level are the key variables for monitoring and controlling the crusher operation.Optimizing Crusher Control E &amp; MJBy continuously measuring and automatically compensating for cone crusher liner wear,the ASRi allows customers to fully utilize crusher liners and schedule liner replacements to coincide with scheduled maintenance stops,Sandvik said,while noting that the ASRi also allows quick and easy remote calibration,even from a control room.
