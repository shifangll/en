A ball mill is a drum grinding unit where balls from solid materials (steel,iron,hard alloys,ceramics,etc) are used Most common are ball mills,where when the drum rotates and the balls rub against the inner walls,the balls are lifted until the lifting angle becomes bigger than the angle of repose Then the grinding media are again belowEnd mills&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;The 2 flute have a larger gullet so more chip clearance.For smaller mills (below 1 2 inch) a 2 flute is a better roughing mill.For finish work or in hard materials,you need more cutting edges so use a 4 flute.If you're going to be working in aluminum,you'll want to get some &quot;high Helix&quot; end mills.The same principle applies between 2 and 4.
