Fractions >25.4 mm were split in two similar samples for secondary crushing in jaw and impact crusher.The particles were crushed in close circuit until most of the material passed the 25.4 mm sieve (P 95 = 95% of the particles passing the 25.4 mm sieve).This size for RCA was oriented for concrete applications rather than the usual pavement.P amp Q University Lesson 72019 9 2 ensp 0183 ensp Most secondary crushers are cone crushers or horizontal shaft impact crushers Tertiary and quaternary crushers are usually cone crushers although some applications can call for vertical shaft impact crushers in these stages GYRATORY CRUSHER A gyratory crusher uses a mantle that gyrates or rotates within a concave bowl
