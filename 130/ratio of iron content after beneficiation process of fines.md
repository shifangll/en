## Mineral dressing (= Orebeneficiation) kau
Mineral dressing (= Orebeneficiation) The first process most ores undergo after they leave the mine is mineral dressing (processing),also called ore preparation,milling,and ore dressing or ore beneficiation Ore dressing is a process of mechanically separating the grains of ore minerals from the gangue minerals,to produce a concentrate.Use of iron ore fines in cold bonded self reducing composite pelletsthe decrepitation index for dextrin + bentonite bonded composite pellets.However,during these beneficiation processes,fines are inadvertently produced.gases are not involved in the cold bonding route since there is no heat hardening.
