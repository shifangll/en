## Rolling (metalworking) Wikipedia
In metalworking,rolling is a metal forming process in which metal stock is passed through one.Most steel mills have rolling mill divisions that convert the semi finished casting products.Skin rolled stock is usually used in subsequent cold working processes where.Create a book &middot; Download as PDF &middot; Printable version.Rolling (metalworking) WikipediaHot rolling is a metalworking process that occurs above the recrystallization temperature of the material.After the grains deform during processing,they recrystallize,which maintains an equiaxed microstructure and prevents the metal from work hardening.The starting material is usually large pieces of metal,like semifinished casting products,such as slabs,blooms,and billets.
