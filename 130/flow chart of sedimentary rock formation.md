## Sedimentary Rocks Lesson #13
Weathering is the process of breaking down rocks and minerals into smaller pieces by water.Sedimentary rocks are formed from the breaking apart of other rocks.The diagram above shows layers of sediment that were laid down in a lake.The Formation of Fossil FuelsSediments form layers at the bottoms of valleys and seas.New layers increase the pressure on older layers.This pressure compacts the sediments.(During compaction,bits of rock are pressed tightly together.) Over time,water flows through the compacted sediments.Most of the water on Earth contains dissolved minerals.

## Igneous Rocks
Geologists have developed a way of classifying the various rocks and understand fairly well where they come from and where they go.There are three general types of rocks,those that form from melt (igneous rocks),those that are deposited from air or water (sedimentary rocks),and those that have formed by &quot;cooking&quot; or&nbsp;.Flow chart for identifying sedimentary rocks — If the rock is made of.naked eye.Silt.Clay.General term.Easily split into thin layers.Grains may be felt between fingers or across teeth.Smooth to fingers or across teeth.Mudrock.Shale.Siltstone.Claystone.B.Sorting (the range of grain clast sizes).C.Shape of grains clasts (sphericity and roundness).Spherical.Elongate.D.Sediment maturity&nbsp;.
