## How to Find Aggregate Crushing Value and Its Test â€¦
Aggregate Crushing Value and Its Test Procedure: One of the test in which concrete material can fail is due to crushing under compressive stress.Aggregate crushing test is standardized by IS: 2386 part IV and used to verify the crushing strength of aggregates.The.Aggregate Crushing Value saratApr 10,2012&#0183;&#32;Aggregates used in the construction,should be strong enough to resist crushing If the aggregates are weak,the stability of the structure is likely to be adversely affected The strength of coarse aggregates is assessed by aggregate crushing test The aggregate crushing value provides a relative measure of resistance to crushing under gradually applied compressive,
