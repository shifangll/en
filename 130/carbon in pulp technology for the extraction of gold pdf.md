## DYNAMIC SIMULATION OF THE CARBON IN PULP AND …
Abstract Carbon in leach and carbon in pulp are continuous processes that use activated carbon in a cascade of large agitated tanks,which have been widely used to recover or concentrate precious metals in gold extraction plants.In the carbon in pulp process adsorption occurs after the …1 ResearchArticle 3 SofieLcke,pulp is mechanically mixed and aerated with compressed air for one week,after which 60 kg granular activated carbon,made from coconut shells,is added to absorb the gold dissolved The pulp is screened,allowing the finely ground ore particles to pass through,but the coarser carbon is captured,dried,and burned to ash Borax
