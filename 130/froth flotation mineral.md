Froth flotation has been a stalwart in mineral beneficiation for more than 100 years During this time,and particularly in the past 20 30 years,there have been significant advances in the design and application of mechanical elements for flotation systems,eg,new mechanisms,launders,larger cell volumes,better pumps,etcFroth flotation ore dressing BritannicaFroth flotation,separation of minerals differing little in density but greatly in wettability by surfactants that stabilize a froth formed on the surface of an agitated suspension of the minerals in water.See flotation.This article was most recently revised and updated by Erik Gregersen,Senior Editor.

## Froth Flotation Process
Froth Flotation.Froth flotation is a surface chemistry based separation process which is extensively used in the processing of mineral ore deposits as a method of separating the desired mineral component from their associated gangue material [17,34].Mineral processingFroth flotation is an important concentration process.This process can be used to separate any two different particles and operated by the surface chemistry of the particles.In flotation,bubbles are introduced into a pulp and the bubbles rise through the pulp.In the process,hydrophobic particles become bound to the surface of the bubbles.

## Flotation ore dressing Britannica
Flotation,in mineral processing,method used to separate and concentrate ores by altering their surfaces to a hydrophobic or hydrophilic condition—that is,the surfaces are either repelled or attracted by water.The flotation process was developed on a commercial scale early in the 20th century toRole of Surfactants in Mineral Processing: An Overview,Nov 10,2018&#0183;&#32;Hence,froth flotation is the single most important unit operation,which is the root solution to all these problems and used for the recovery and upgradation of valuable mineral,especially below 150 Froth flotation which uses the difference in physico chemical surface properties of minerals is employed in several industries for fines processing
