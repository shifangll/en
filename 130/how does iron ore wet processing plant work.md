## Iron ore Wikipedia
Iron ore is the raw material used to make pig iron,which is one of the main raw materials to make steel—98% of the mined iron ore is used to make steel.Indeed,it has been argued that iron ore is "more integral to the global economy than any other commodity,except perhaps oil".Iron ore pelletizing MetsoIron ore pelletizing.Iron ore fines are agglomerated into pellets and then indurated using a furnace to create iron ore pellets.These are typically fed to a blast furnace or DRI plant as part of the process to make steel.Metso is the only supplier of both Straight Grate and Grate Kiln pellet plants.Features.Metso is the only supplier in.
