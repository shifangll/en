## Vacuum ceramic filter
The typical filter for extracting iron contains 12 ceramic filtering plates of the filtering elements (discs),which have a diameter of about 2705 mm,making the total filter surface 120 m 2.[11] This filter is most suited to filter feed slurries with high solid concentrations ( 20% w w) [2] and particles ranging in size from 1 700 &#181;m.[2]Iron Ore Pelletizing Essential in Meeting Future Steel NeedsIron ore pelletizing,or balling,is the process of transforming fines into spherical granules anywhere from 8 16mm in size via tumble growth (agitation) agglomeration using either a disc pelletizer (pan granulator) or rotary drum.
