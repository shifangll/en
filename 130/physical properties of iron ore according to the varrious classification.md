## Mineral Classification,An Organizational Necessity
With over 3,000 different types of minerals a system is needed to make sense of them all.Mineralogists group minerals into families based on their chemical composition.Several important metal ores come from this group like the pyrite pictured here that is an iron ore.Tools to test the properties of minerals for identification $17.49.Iron Simple English Wikipedia,the free encyclopediaPhysical properties.Iron is a grey,silvery metal.It is magnetic,though different allotropes of iron have different magnetic qualities.Iron is easily found,mined and smelted,which is why it is so useful.Pure iron is soft and very malleable and is able to stretch a lot,while steel (iron mixed with a little carbon) is stronger and does not stretch as much as iron.
