## Portland cement Wikipedia
It is a fine powder,produced by heating limestone and clay minerals in a kiln to form clinker,grinding the clinker,and adding 2 to 3 percent of gypsum Several types of Portland cement are availableCement clinkerCement clinker is a solid material produced in the manufacture of Portland cement as an intermediary product.Clinker occurs as lumps or nodules,usually 3 millimetres (0.12 in) to 25 millimetres (0.98 in) in diameter.It is produced by sintering (fusing together without melting to the point of liquefaction) limestone and aluminosilicate materials such as clay during the cement kiln stage.
