## Calcium carbonate Wikipedia
Calcium carbonate is a chemical compound with the formula Ca CO 3It is a common substance found in rocks as the minerals calcite and aragonite (most notably as limestone,which is a type of sedimentary rock consisting mainly of calcite) and is the main component of pearls and the shells of marine organisms,snails,and eggsCalcium carbonate is the active ingredient in agricultural lime and.The Mineral Industry of Madagascar in 2008 USGS Mineral.ruby and sapphire,by an estimated 82% each; quartz,by 46%; and chromite,by 31%.of refined nickel and 5,600 t yr of cobalt; the mine was expected.
