## Effect of Partial Replacement of Sand by Iron Ore Tailings,
Abstract Iron ore tailing (IOT) is a waste generated from iron ore industry Millions of tonnes of IOT are produced every year in India and disposal of the same is a huge problem as it cause to environmental pollution,The ingredients of concrete are coarse aggregate,fine aggregate,binding material and water Rapid increaseiron ore waste as coarse aggregate in concreteThe iron ore tailings aggregates concrete exhibited a good mechanical this sector where recycled waste products could be considered as construction and building materi tailings are segregated properly,both fine and coarse aggregates for concrete can be obtainedThe iron ore tailings aggregates concrete exhibited a good mechanical strength and even in the case of compressive strength,there.
