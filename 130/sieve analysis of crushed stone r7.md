## Stone Crusher Gradation Analysis
Gradation of stone and rock is found by ASTM C136,the Test Method for Sieve Analysis of Fine and Coarse,Evaluation of aggregate particle shapes through multiple crush,A good analogy would be to describe the gradation of an ASTM #57 stone by giving only the,11 compares the weighted average of all three stages of crushing3 8″ Pea Gravel & 3 8″ Crushed Stone Vita CreteCustomers and Users of Vita Crete® Pea Gravel or Crushed Stone: Pea Gravel is semi round Crushed stone is more angular Both are clean,dried and free of organic deleterious materials Conforms to ASTM C 33 specifications for 3 8” aggregate The color is light beige,grey and pink but slight variations do occur
