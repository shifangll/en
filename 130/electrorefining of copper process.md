## copper processing Definition,History,& Facts.
In the electrolytic process,copper anodes and starting sheets are immersed in an electrolytic solution made up of copper sulfate and sulfuric acid.An electric current is passed through the solution,and copper from the positively charged anode is deposited in a pure form on the negatively charged starting sheet,which acts as a cathode.Electrowinning ExplainedHistory.Electrowinning is the oldest industrial electrolytic process.The English chemist Humphry Davy obtained sodium metal in elemental form for the first time in 1807 by the electrolysis of molten sodium hydroxide.Electrorefining of copper was first demonstrated experimentally by Maximilian,Duke of Leuchtenberg in 1883.

Copper Electrorefining Last step.The end result of of the copper smelter operations is anode copper which is 99% pure (see graphic on the left).An example where copper is further purified is at the Asarco electrolytic plant in Amarillo,Texas.The 99% pure copper from the anode furnace is cast into 750 pound,3 inch thick,rectangular slabs called anodes.The final step is a process called.Electrorefining of Copper Anode CopperElectrorefining of Copper.1.Electrorefining General Introduction In an electrorefining process,the anode is the impure metal and the impurities must be lost during the passage of the metal from the anode to the cathode during electrolysis,i.e.the electrode reactions are,at the anode: M → Mn+ + neand at the cathode: Mn+ + ne → M.

## Benefits of Agglomeration in an SX EW Process for…
Combined with heap leaching and agglomeration,the effectiveness of Solvent Extraction Electrowinning (SX EW) is increased.How Hydrometallurgy and the SX EW Process Made. CopperThe electrowinning of copper requires considerably more electrical energy than does the electrorefining process an average of about 8 MJ kg for electrowinning vs about 1.5 MJ kg for electrorefining.In electrowinning the copper must be reduced from the cupric form to metal; whereas,in electrorefining the copper is already in metallic form.

## PRODUCTION OF ELECTROLYTIC COPPER POWDER IN A.
Pure and fine copper powders with dispersive shapes from electrorefining process and dendritic shape from electrowinning process were obtained as indicated.ElectrorefiningThe thermodynamic basis of copper electrorefining can be understood from the potential pH diagram shown in Figure 3.10.1.In this process,the anode reaction is oxygen evolution,which is shown as line b in the potential pH diagram.The reaction proceeds atb.
