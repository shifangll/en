Aluminium can be extracted (uneconomically) from some clays but the most common aluminium ore is a material called bauxite First the aluminium ore needs to be mined,then the bauxite is refined into alumina (aluminium oxide) Large amounts of electricity are used to smelt the alumina into aluminium metal PropertiesExtraction Process of Aluminium from Bauxite OreApr 11,2016&#0183;&#32;Other major steps in the process are the precipitation of aluminum hydroxide from the sodium aluminate liquor and the calcination of the aluminum hydroxide to produce aluminum oxide (alumina) In this study the minus 15″ bauxite ore is ground to minus 3 16″ in a Steel Head Rod Mill operating in open circuit The ore is ground wet with hot.

Aug 16,2012&#0183;&#32;After alumina is extracted from bauxite ore,further processing called 'smelting' is necessary to convert it into aluminum In this process,alumina is dissolved in a solution and a strong electric current is applied This process has generally remained unchanged since its invention in 1886Alumina Refining The Aluminum AssociationQuick Read.Alumina is the common name given to aluminum oxide (Al 2 O 3).Alumina is produced from bauxite,an ore that is mined from topsoil in various tropical and.
