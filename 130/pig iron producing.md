## What is the method of production of pig iron by using a blast.
Feb 12,2018.Pig iron is produced in blast furnace by reducing iron ore with carbon monoxide( indirect reduction ) and carbon ( direct reduction ).Iron Production Ohio History CentralMost of these furnaces produced pig iron,which would then be constructed into machinery,building supplies and kitchen items A few people established iron forges,which produced a higher quality of iron than furnac Initially,most iron furnaces in Ohio were located in the northeastern section of the state
