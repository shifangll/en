## Waste Disposal & Recycling in Steel Industry
The steel industry in North America has been recycling steel scrap for more than 150 years.The steel industry needs scrap to produce new steel,which ensures that all steel products contain anywhere from 25 percent up to 100 percent recycled content.It also is cheaper to recycle steel than it is to mine virgin ore to manufacture new steel.3 Iron Unit Recycling Department of EnergyChapter 3: Iron Unit Recycling 56 Steel Technology Roadmap.Figure 3 5.Major By products: Generation Rates,Iron Content,and Barriers to Recycling (U.S.) Unless creative approaches can be found to advance the utilization of these materials,tighter environmental regulations and closure of landfills will force disposal costs to escalate even.
