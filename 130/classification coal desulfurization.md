## Flue Gas Desulfurization CS Indonesian Thermal Coal Index
Flue Gas Desulfurization Flue gas desulfurization is commonly known as FGD and is the technology used for removing sulfur dioxide (SO2) from the exhaust flue gases in power plants that burn coal or oil to produce steam for the steam turbines that drive their electricity generators.classifiion coal desulfurization albouwCoal classifiion: Coal classifiion,any of various ways in which coal is grouped.Most classifiions are based on the results of chemical analyses and physical tests,but some are more empirical in nature.Coal classifiions are important because they provide valuable information to commercial users and to researchers.Desulfurization
