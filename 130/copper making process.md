## Copper Mining and Processing: Processing of Copper Ores,
Copper processing is a complicated process that begins with mining of the ore (less than 1% copper) and ends with sheets of 9999% pure copper called cathodes,which will ultimately be made into products for everyday useWhat is the process of making copper oxide?Well,firstly,there are two types of copper oxide.Copper (I) oxide,Cu2O.(Cuprous Oxide) and Copper (II) oxide,CuO.(Cupric Oxide) So,I’ll explain both.The most common way copper (I) oxide is formed is by oxidation of copper metal.4Cu + O2.
