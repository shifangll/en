## Overview of Proppants and Existing Standards and Practices
• Absolute density is the density the material would have if no intra granular porosity is present.(e.g.Boyle’s Law porosimetry) ©2013 John Getty,Montana Tech : Bulk Density Apparatus : 16 ©2013 John Getty,Montana Tech : Crush resistance : ISO 13503 2 §11 • Load a crush cell with (e.g.) 4lb ft: 2 • Ramp load to desired stress level • Sieve to determine “fines” produced.Density of Construction Materials in kg m3 and lb ft3Density of construction materials are its mass per unit volume of materials.It is expressed in kg m3 or lb ft3 and shows compactness of building material.
