## Linear motor
1&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;A linear motor is an electric motor that has had its stator and rotor &quot;unrolled&quot; thus instead of producing a torque it produces a linear force along its length.However,linear motors are not necessarily straight.Characteristically,a linear motor's active section has ends,whereas more conventional motors are arranged as a continuous loop.Linear induction motor WikipediaThe history of linear electric motors can be traced back at least as far as the 1840s to the work of Charles Wheatstone at King's College in London,but Wheatstone's model was too inefficient to be practical A feasible linear induction motor is described in US patent 782312 (1905; inventor Alfred Zehden of Frankfurt am Main),and is for driving trains or lifts
