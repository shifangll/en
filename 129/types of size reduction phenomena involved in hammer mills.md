## Rolling (metalworking) Wikipedia
Hot rolling is a metalworking process that occurs above the recrystallization temperature of the material.After the grains deform during processing,they recrystallize,which maintains an equiaxed microstructure and prevents the metal from work hardening.The starting material is usually large pieces of metal,like semi finished casting products,such as slabs,blooms,and billets.Impact Crusher Working PrincipleF80 = 80 percent passing size of the feed (micrometers) P80 = 80 percent passing size of the product (micrometers) The Work Index for rod and ball mills can be determined from laboratory tests and,as demonstrated by Rowland,the relationship gives us a reasonably accurate tool for the design of rotary grinding mill circuits.

## Crusher
A crusher is a machine designed to reduce large rocks into smaller rocks,gravel,or rock dust.Crushers may be used to reduce the size,or change the form,of waste materials so they can be more easily disposed of or recycled,or to reduce the size of a solid mix of raw materials (as in rock ore),so that pieces of different composition can be differentiated.
