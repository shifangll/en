## CO2 Emissions Profile of the US Cement Industry
2 Cement production also is a key source of CO2 emissions,due in part to the significant reliance on coal and petroleum coke to fuel the kilns for clinker production Globally,CO2 emissions from cement production were estimated at 829 MMTCO2 in 2000 7,approximately 34% of global CO 2Environmental impact of concrete WikipediaThe environmental impact of concrete,its manufacture and applications,are complex.The cement industry is one of the primary producers of carbon dioxide.With the use of coal ash or another suitable substitute,this concrete could.
