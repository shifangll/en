## What is the use of coal in the cement manufacturing.
Coal is used to burn raw material to clinkering temp.i.e 1450 degree centigrade.Low grade coal can be used for cement manufacturing but it will need high grade of limestone for good quality cement.you can say low grade coal need high grade limestone and high grade coal need low grade limestone.Portland cement WikipediaThe most common use for Portland cement is in the production of concrete.Concrete is a composite material consisting of aggregate (gravel and sand),cement,and water.As a construction material,concrete can be cast in almost any shape desired,and once hardened,can become a structural (load bearing) element.
