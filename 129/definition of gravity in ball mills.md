## Grinding Media Glen Mills
The range of specific gravity for commercially available grinding media runs from sp.gr.1.0 for plastics to sp.gr.15 for tungsten carbide.It makes sense that you wouldn’t select a very light grinding bead for a highly viscous system or a very dense grinding bead for a low solids aqueous suspension.Ball mill WikipediaA ball mill is a type of grinder used to grind and blend materials for use in mineral dressing processes,paints,pyrotechnics,ceramics and selective laser sintering.It works on the principle of impact and attrition: size reduction is done by impact as the balls drop from near the top of the shell.A ball mill consists of a hollow cylindrical shell rotating about its axis.The axis of the.
