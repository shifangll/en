## Breakage Characteristics of Heat Treated Line. MDPI
Jan 12,2018.Sj represents the probability that a particle will be broken by the application of force.Materials with higher strength have a smaller crushing probability [13],and a given material can show different probability depending on the particle size.In general,in a ball mill,the smaller the particle size,the smaller the.Influence of raw material particle size on quality of pellets.Jul 18,2013.Iron ore fines of −10 mm size and line are ground together in a ball mill to get sufficient fineness for the balling process.However,as.
