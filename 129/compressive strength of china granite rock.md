## Compressive strength of rocks PetroWiki
Compressive strength of rocks.Mechanical failure in rocks generally means either fracturing or permanent deformation as a result of compression.While many methods for calculating failure relationships exist,an initial measure of the compressive strength of reservoir rocks is still needed for use in those calculations.Contents.1 Estimating.ASTM Test Results Select StoneCorinthian Granite 0.17%; Summit Granite 0.076%; Compressive Strength.Compressive Strength is the stress,in pounds per square inch (psi) that will rupture a stone sample.Very rarely is the compressive strength of a stone much of a factor in stone selection.
