## GRINDING FEEDS AND SPEEDS ABRASIVE ENGINEERING
Grinding wheel speeds should be maintalned with in a range of 5000 to 6500 feet per minute (1525 to 1980 meters per mm),unless special conditions prevall or equipment and wheels designed for substantially higher wheel speeds are used.Belt Grinder Belt RPM BladeForums.com · Stroke feet or linear feet per minute,need to know circumterance of drive wheel times by R P M.So if you have a 4 inch drive wheel times pi or 3.14  is about 12 inches times times 1000 r p m = 12000 inches divide by 12 for feet and it is moving about a thousand feet a minute.
