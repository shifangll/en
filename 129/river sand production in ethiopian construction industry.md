Why is sea sand not used for construction purposes? How does it affect the structure?.From my experience in the construction industry structural concrete is usually made from crushed aggregate.we mix both smooth particles we didn't get much friction to grip bricks to hold tightly instead of sea sand if we use river sand we can observe.Literature Review on Different Plastic Waste Materials Use,the compressive and split tensile strength He used concrete mix by using Ordinary Portland Cement,Natural River sand as fine aggregate and crushed granite stones as coarse aggregate,portable water free from impurities and containing varying percentage of waste plastic bags (0%,02%,04%,06% 08% and 10%)
