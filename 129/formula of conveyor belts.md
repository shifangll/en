## Belt Speed Calculator Calculator Academy
Oct 27,2021&#0183;&#32;The following formula is used to calculate the belt speed of a conveyor system V = pi 2 * D * RPM 60 Where V is the belt speed (distance time) D is the diameter of the pulley (length) RPM is rotations per minute; Belt Speed Definition A belt speed is defined as the linear velocity of the belt on a single conveyor system with a given diameterConveyor Belts McMaster CarrFood Industry Cut Resistant Conveyor Belting Unlike traditional belt and roller conveyors that mainly move products,this plastic belting creates a hard,cut resistant work surface— similar to a cutting board— that stands up to food processing jobs,such as cutting,deboning,and shelling It’s FDA compliant for direct contact with food
