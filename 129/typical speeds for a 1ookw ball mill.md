## Milling Speed and Feed Calculator
Milling operations remove material by feeding a workpiece into a rotating cutting tool with sharp teeth,such as an end mill or face mill.Calculations use the desired tool diameter,number of teeth,cutting speed,and cutting feed,which should be chosen based on the specific cutting conditions,including the workpiece material and tool material.Ball MillsThe point where the mill becomes a centrifuge is called the &quot;Critical Speed&quot;,and ball mills usually operate at 65% to 75% of the critical speed.Ball Mills are generally used to grind material 1 4 inch and finer,down to the particle s
