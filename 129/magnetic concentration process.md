## magnetic concentration process
Manganese Magnetic Concentration Process Yantai … Manganese ore processing technology is based on its different principles,there are many methods,now in China magnetic concentration is the most widely used in manganese ore processing technology,after rough concentration and selected concentration then get the concentrate.It is a high technological enterprise that integrated research.Magnets Boundless PhysicsAn electric current flowing in a wire creates a magnetic field around the wire.To concentrate the magnetic field,the wire is wound into a coil with many turns of wire lying side by side.The magnetic field from all the turns of wire passes through the center of the coil creating a strong magnetic field there.
