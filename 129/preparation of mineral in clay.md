## A recommended procedure for the preparation of oriented.
Extremely well oriented clay mineral mounts for X ray diffraction analysis can be prepared quickly and without introducing segregation using the filter membrane peel technique.Mounting problems encountered with smectite rich samples can be resolved by using minimal sample and partial air drying of the clay film before transfer to a glass slide.Preparation and application of clay mineral films.A clay mineral dispersion is dropped at the centre of a disk (or a substrate),which is rotated at a high rotational speed ().The clay mineral dispersion is spread over the disk according to the centrifugal force,and at the same time,the solvent evaporates.
