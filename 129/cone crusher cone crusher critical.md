Cone Crusher Applications.A general rule of thumb for applying Cone Crushers is the reduction ratio.A crusher with coarse style liners would typically have a 6:1 reduction ratio.Thus,with a 3⁄4” closed side setting,the maximum feed would be 6 x 3⁄4 or 4.5 inches.Reduction ratios of 8:1 may be possible in certain coarse crushing.Cone Crusher vs VSI (Vertical Shaft Impactor)Cone Cusher VSI (Vertical Shaft Impactor) Cone crusher is a primary crusher,used in mining or Ore processing.It reduces large aggregates to smaller aggregate.VSI means,'Vertical Shaft Impactor'.In which shaft and crushing chamber are in a vertical position
