## Halite salt: The mineral Halite information and pictures
Halite,the natural form of salt,is a very common and well known mineral.It is found in solid masses,and as a dissolved solution in the oceans and in salt lakes.The inland lakes that are rich in salt exist in arid regions,and may also be below sea level without an outlet.These lakes evaporate during dry seasons,causing a recession in the water level and an increase of salinity content.Calcite and Dolomite University of PittsburghCalcite and dolomite are very similar minerals.Both have the same hardness (H = 3),the same rhombohedral cleavage,and are found in identical geologic settings.
