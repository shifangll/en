## nickel matte chloride leaching Outotec
Because the Outotec process is based on a calcium chloride solution,it enables easy acid and base regener ation.Base metals are leached in oxidative conditions at atmospheric pressure,iron is precipitated with line,and base metals are purified by solvent extraction,using ammonia as the neutralization agent.Calcium (Ca) and water LenntechCalcium and water: reaction mechanisms,environmental impact and health effects.Rivers generally contain 1 2 ppm calcium,but in lime areas rivers may contains calcium concentrations as high as 100 ppm.Calcium can extract sulphur dioxide from industrial exhaust,and neutralize sulphuric acids before discharge.

## Calcium carbonate The Essential Chemical Industry
In the chemical industry,large quantities of line are heated to ca 1500 K to form calcium oxide,known as quicklime: Water can be added to lime to form calcium hydroxide.The process is known as &#39;slaking&#39;.Solid calcium hydroxide is known as slaked lime or hydrated lime,and solutions and suspensions in water as.Calcium Northeast Organic Farming AssociationIt also helps to neutralize toxic materials in a plant.Calcium assists in the development of soil structure.It also acts as a filler to maintain balance among cation nutrients and to limit the influence of acid cations.Retention of calcium in the soil and its function as a balancing agent depends upon the cation exchange properties.
