This paper shows results of analyses based on samples of the material extracted during process of rock wool production: raw materials,final product,and wastes.On the basis of microscopic,chemical,X ray diffraction,and Mössbauer spectroscopy analyses,different mineral forms of iron compounds are described.Distribution of iron was determined and ways of transformation of iron minerals.The primary reason for using Rockwool,or any substrate,in a hydroponic growing system is to provide a buffering reservoir of nutrient solution in the root zone.
