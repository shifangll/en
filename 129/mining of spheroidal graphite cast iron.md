## Cast Iron Foundry,Gray Iron and Ductile Iron Casting
Ductile Iron Casting Ductile iron is also referred to as nodular cast iron and is spheroidal graphite iron because the graphite within the metal takes the shape of nodules instead of elongated flak The rounded shape of these graphite inclusions inhibit the formation of cracks and stress points,giving the alloy enhanced ductilityDifference Between Ductile Iron and Cast Iron l Ductile,Mar 05,2011&#0183;&#32;When considering the metallurgy of ductile iron,it shows the structural alteration of graphite,since,in the development of this material,the graphite creates spherical nodules that restrict the development of fissures thereby resulting in increased malleability
