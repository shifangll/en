## Fresh Concrete: Workability
Contribution to better workability of rounded aggregate will come from the fact that for the given volume or weight it will have less surface area and less voids than angular or flaky aggregate.Not only that,being round in shape,the frictional resistance is also greatly reduced.This explains the reason why river sand and gravel provide greater workability to concrete than crushed sand and.Effect of Using Crushed Limestone in Concrete Mixes as Fine …reduces the effect of absorption[I],while the difference of angularity between crushed rock and natural sand still plays a major part in workability [5].
