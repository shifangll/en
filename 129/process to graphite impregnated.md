resistance of graphite in an oxidizing atmosphere can be increased to over 600 C.In a non oxidizing atmosphere,the temperature resistance of carbon graphite and graphite is determined by the treatment temperature during the production process and thus isPatent US3031342 Graphite impregnation method Google PatentsFor example,the surface pores of graphite can be filled with sodium fluoride,thereby rendering the graphite capable of containing salts having a melting point lower than that of sodium fluoride.Refractory materials can be impregnated with molten salts by immersing the refractory in the salt under pressure.However,if the&nbsp;.
