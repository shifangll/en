## Steel Effects of heat treating Britannica
Steel Effects of heat treating: Adjusting the carbon content is the simplest way to change the mechanical properties of steel Additional changes are made possible by heat treating—for instance,by accelerating the rate of cooling through the austenite to ferrite transformation point,shown by,Carbon steel WikipediaCarbon steel is a steel with carbon content up to 21% by weight The definition of carbon steel from the American Iron and Steel Institute (AISI) states: Steel is considered to be carbon steel when: no minimum content is specified or required for chromium,cobalt,molybdenum,nickel,niobium,titanium,tungsten,vanadium,zirconium,or any other element to be added to obtain a desired.
