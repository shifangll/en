## AMIT 135: Lesson 7 Ball Mills &amp; Circuits Mining Mill.
Mill Type Overview.Three types of mill design are common.The Overflow Discharge mill is best suited for fine grinding to 75 106 microns.; The Diaphram or Grate Discharge mill keeps coarse particles within the mill for additional grinding and typically used for grinds to 150 250 microns.; The Center Periphery DiGrinding Mills: Ball Mill &amp; Rod Mill Design &amp; PartsBall Mill Motor Sizing Calculation Example.A 7 ft diameter dry grinding diaphragm mill has a 40 percent ball charge and a speed of 23.6 rpm.What is the horsepower per foot of length? The mill has 2 in.thick shell liners.From graph,Fig.3,12,mill having 6 ft 8 in.inside diameter will have 4400 lb of balls per ft of mill length.

The ball mill is a key piece of equipment for grinding crushed materials,and is widely used in production of powders such as cement,silicates,refractory material,and glass ceramics,as well as for ore dressing of both ferrous and non ferrous metals.Ball mills can grind wet or dry and can be continuous or batch type mills.Dry Grinding Attritors: Batch or Continuous MillsThe SD Dry Grinding Attritors can be operated in both continuous and batch processing applications.In the continuous operation,the material is fed into the vessel at the top.It then migrates through the agitating media bed where it is processed to a desired particle size and is discharged through metering bar grids at the bottom of the tank.
