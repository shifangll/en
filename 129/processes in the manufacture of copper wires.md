## Types of Copper Wire
Copper wire is typically defined as consisting of a single conductor for electrical signals,differentiated from a copper cable wherein multiple copper wires are grouped into a common jacket.The many types of copper wire share a common function — the conduction of electricity with minimal resistance which causes voltage drops and energy.Manufacturing process and microstructure of copper coated.Copper coated aluminum wires exhibit good electrical conductivity,high thermal conductivity,low contact resistance of copper and low density,and provide economic advantages over aluminum.However,there are some problems in the manufacturing processes of hot dip copper coated aluminum wires,such.
