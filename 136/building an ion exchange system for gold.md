Ion exchange: Ion exchange protein powder is made by taking a concentrate and running it through what is called an &quot;ion exchange&quot; column to get an &quot;ion exchange whey isolate.&quot; The benefit of an ion exchange isolate is that it gives you the very highest protein content per gram,but the higher protein content comes at cost: a loss of many of the milk subfractions unique to whey.GoldGold mining operations are improving their economics out of financial necessity and innovations in gold hydrometallurgy are emerging on a regular basis as operations trim down.DuPont has long been at the forefront of many of these new developments with the commercial use of DuPont's ion exchange resins in the primary recovery of gold in mining operations.
