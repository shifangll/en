## Direct reduced iron
Direct reduced iron (DRI),also called sponge iron,[1] is produced from the direct reduction of iron ore (in the form of lumps,pellets,or fines) to iron by a reducing gas or elemental carbon produced from natural gas or coal.Many ores are suitable for direct reduction.Direct reduction refers to solid state processes which reduce iron.Coal briquetting process&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;This invention concerns a coal briquetting process,and more especially it concerns a process for &quot;cold&quot; briquetting.There exist many processes for briquetting fine coals in which the mixture fed to the briquetting press is hot,and various binders which melt at the.
