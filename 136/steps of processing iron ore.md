## Steps in the Modern Steelmaking Process
Methods for manufacturing steel have evolved significantly since industrial production began in the late 19th century.Modern methods,however,are still based on the same premise as the original Bessemer Process,which uses oxygen to lower the carbon content in iron.Processing,smelting and refining gold World Gold CouncilFor extracting gold from low grade ores,heap leaching is practiced; huge heaps are sprayed with a dilute solution of sodium cyanide,and this percolates down through the piled ore,dissolving the gold.There are very well defined rules for the safe and responsible.
