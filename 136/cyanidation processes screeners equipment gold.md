## Processing,smelting and refining gold World Gold Council
When gold dissolution is complete,the gold bearing solution is separated from the solids.With ores of higher gold content (greater than 20 grams of gold per tonne of ore),cyanidation is accomplished by vat leaching,which involves holding a slurry of ore andGold extractionGold extraction refers to the processes required to extract gold from its ores.This may require a combination of comminution,mineral processing,hydrometallurgical,and pyrometallurgical processes to be performed on the ore.[1] Gold mining from alluvium ores was once achieved by techniques associated with placer mining such as simple gold.
