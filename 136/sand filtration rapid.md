Rapid Sand Filters Rapid sand filters pertama kali didesign oleh oleh George W.Fuller di Little Falls,New Jersey Amerika pada tahun 1920 an.Design ini banyak digunakan di sistem pengolahan air pemerintah Amerika diberbagai tempat sejak kesuksesannya di tahun tersebut,karena design ini tidak membutuhkan tempat yang luas dibandingkan slow sand filter.Conventional Water Treatment: Coagulation and Filtration …Rapid sand filtration is much more common than flow sand filtration,because rapid sand filters have fairly high flow rates and require relatively little space to operate.In fact,during rapid sand filtration,the water flows at a rate up to 20 metres per hour.The filters.

## What is a Rapid Sand Filter? (with pictures)
&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;Rapid sand filtration takes place in a tank containing one or more layers of grainy media,such as sand,anthracite or hard coal,garnet,magnetite,or other minerals.The total media depth typically ranges from 6 feet (about 0.1.8 meters).Rapid sand filterThe filtration system requires a relatively small land area in proportion to the population served,and the design is less sensitive to changes in raw water quality,e.g.turbidity,than slow sand filters.Rapid sand filters use relatively coarse sand and other granularfloc

## An Introduction To Slow Sand Filtration
Types Of Sand Filter 4 1.2.Rapid Sand Filters These filters use coarser sand than slow sand filters and the effective size of the filter media is usually greater than 0.55 mm.The flow rates are normally between 4 and 21 m h equating to 400 to 2100 l h per m2 of filter.Rapid vs slow filtrationSand filters should not be confused with Roughing Filters,which tend to be horizontal flow gravel filters used as a roughing treatment for turbid raw waters prior to sand filtration.The two sand filtration processes differ from each other in several ways.

Rapid sand filtration,in contrast to slow sand filtration,is a purely physical treatment process.As the water flows through several layers of coarse grained sand and gravel,relatively large particles are held back safely (DIJK &amp; OOMEN 1978).AquaNES DSSIn rapid sand filtration the influent water flows down through sand and support gravel and is collected by an underdrain system below.The filter tank is generally constructed of concrete.It can be constructed as open tank (rapid gravity filter) or closed tank
