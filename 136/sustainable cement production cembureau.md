## Raw Material Substitution
The main raw material used in cement production has traditionally been limestone.Limestone is abundantly available,but over 60% of the industry’s CO 2 emissions are caused by transformation of limestone into lime,called “decarbonation”.Accordingly,part of the.SuStainable cement productioncement.In concrete production,cement,aggregates and other suitable materials are mixed with water.When water is added to cement,it re acts and forms a glue which binds together the other main constituents of concrete.Extraction Grinding Grinding
