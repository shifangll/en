85 Research Article Developing an optimization model for CO 2 reduction in cement production process S.O.Ogbeide* Department of Mechanical Engineering,Ambrose Alli University,P.M.B 14,Ekpoma,Edo State,Nigeria.Received 17 November 2009; RevisedOptimization of bio cement production from cement kiln,01 09 2019&#0183;&#32;The main aim of this study was to maximize bio cement (CaCO 3) production through a waste feedstock of cement kiln dust (CKD) as a source of calcium by deployment of microalgae sp Chlorella kessleri The effect of process parameters such as temperature,pH and time intervals of microalgae cultivation,were set as criteria that ultimately subscribe to a process of optimization

cement is made by heating limestone (calcium carbonate) with other materials (such as cla y) to 1450 &#176;C in a kiln,in a process known as calcinations,whereby a molecule of carbon dioxide is.Industrial : Optimization for the Cement IndustryCement Kiln Optimization Controlling a cement rotary kiln is a very difficult task The process is intrinsically unstable and there are long time delays and large pertur bations acting on it Only a perfect mix of expe rience,deep knowledge,mathematical tech niques and state of the art software can achieve optimal behaviour over long periods.

## OPTIMIZATION METHODS FOR BATCH SCHEDULING
INTRODUCTION PROBLEM DEFINITION Scheduling is a decision making process thay plays an important role in most manufacturing and service industries The scheduling function aims to optimally allocate resources,available in limited supplies,to processing tasks over time Each task requires certain amounts of specified resources for a specific.Manufacture of CementManufacturing of cement involves various raw materials and processes.Each process is explained chemical reactions for manufacture of Portland Cement.Fig: Manufacture of Cement by Dry Process b) Wet ProcessThe raw materials are firstly crushed and made.
