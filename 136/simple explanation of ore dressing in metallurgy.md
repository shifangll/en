Thank you Unnati Ramteke for A2A answer.See there is nothing can come easily and nothing can go hardly without your involvement or having experience or already been as a experienced.I can counsel to you is that every typical stream has it’s ow.Steps involved in Extraction of metals Winner Science1.Crushing and Grinding First of all,ores are crushed into a fine powder in big jaw crushers and ball mills.This method is called pulverization.2.Concentration (Dressing) of ores The technique of removing gangue,the rocky impurities like Sio 2 present in an ore,is called concentration of an ore or ore dressing and the purified ore is called concentrated ore.
