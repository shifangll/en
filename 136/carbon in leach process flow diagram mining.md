## Carbon in pulp
Carbon in pulp (CIP) is an extraction technique for recovery of gold which has been liberated into a cyanide solution as part of the gold cyanidation process.[1] Introduced in the early 1980s,Carbon in Pulp is regarded as a simple and cheap process.As such it is used in most industrial applications where the presence of competing silver or.carbon in leach process flow chartdiagram gold leaching process.flow of leaching process schievelavabojourdan.be.carbon in leach process flowchart labourworxsa.co.za.process flow chart leaching gold processing ,flow of leaching process gcpain The processing of potash ores by hot leaching with further,the reactor The process design of gold leaching and,flow chart of chemical process.
