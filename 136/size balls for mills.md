﻿ A) Total Apparent Volumetric Charge Filling including balls and excess slurry on top of the ball charge,plus the interstitial voids in between the balls expressed as a percentage of the net internal mill volume (inside liners).B) Overflow Discharge Mills operating at low ball fillings slurry may accumulate on tOptimum choice of the make up ball sizes for maximum.1.Introduction.The ball size is one of the critical factors for determining the mill performance of ball mills.It is well known that larger balls are needed for the effective breakage of large size particles,whereas smaller balls are more effective for the breakage of fine particles.
