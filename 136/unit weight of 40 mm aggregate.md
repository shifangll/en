## Standard Test Method for Bulk Density (“Unit Weight”) and,
11 This test method covers the determination of bulk density (“unit weight”) of aggregate in a compacted or loose condition,and calculated voids between particles in fine,coarse,or mixed aggregates based on the same determination This test method is applicable to aggregates not exceeding 125 mm [5 in] in nominal maximum sizeACI Mix Design ExampleA concrete mix is to be designed for use in a 250 mm (10 inch) thick JPCP pavement.The desired properties are: Slump = 25 mm (1.0 inch) Average day flexural strength of at least 4.5 MPa (650 psi) Coarse aggregate: nominal maximum size = 37.5 mm (1.5 inch),dry rodded weight = 1600 kg m 3 (100 lb ft 3),specific gravity = 2.68,moisture content = 1.0 percent,absorption = 0.5 percent
