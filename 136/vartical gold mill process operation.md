The EXAMPLE Gold Mill is designed to process 500 tonnes per day of ore.The flowsheets are conventional and consist of two stages of crushing,single stage ball mill grinding,cyanidation and a Merrill Crowe precipitation circuit for gold and silver recovery.In addition to the cyanide circuit,gold leach residue is treated in a flotation stage.Gold CIL &amp; CIP Gold Leaching Process Explained CCDThe gold cyanide complex is then extracted from the pulp or slurry by adsorption onto activated carbon.CIL stands for carbon in leach.This is a gold extraction process called cyanidation where carbon is added to the leach tanks (or reaction vessel) so that leaching and adsorption take place in the same tanks.

## Milling Machine: Methods of Milling.Milling Processes
Milling is an important process of manufacturing technology and basically it refers to the removal of metal from the work piece using a tool which has several cutting points and is rotating about its axis.Thus each cutting point removes a little bit of the metal but since there are multiple such points and the toMilling (machining)Milling is the process of machining using rotary cutters to remove material by advancing a cutter into a workpiece.This may be done varying direction on one or several axes,cutter head speed,and pressure.Milling covers a wide variety of different operations and machines,on scales from small individual parts to large,heavy duty gang milling operations.

## Metallurgy &amp; Mineral Processing
1 Over the past 15 years,mine to mill studies have focused attention on the impact blast fragmentation has on concentrator throughput.Blasting provides the first opportunity for comminution or size reduction.It is also a cheaper and more efficientCement grinding Vertical roller mills versus ball millsGrinding process The grinding process in ball mills and vertical roller mills differ fundamentally.In a ball mill the comminution takes place by impact and attrition.The comminution in the vertical roller mill takes place by exposing a bed of material to a pressure
