## Determination of Aggregate Impact Value
The aggregate impact value is a calculation of the resistance to abrupt impact,bang or shock,which may vary from its resistance to steadily,applied compressive weight.Procedure: The test specimen includes the aggregates of size ranging from 10.0 mm 12.5 mm.Aggregates can be dehydrated by warming them at temperatue of 110&#176; C for a timeframe of 4 hours and spread to cool down.Transportation Research Record I 106 The Use of the Clegg,Impact Value ( CIV),but indicate that the coefficients may vary,aggregate surfaced,low volume roads to manage traffic during spring breakup,and in designing surfac In addition to,BB test compared to the dynamic impact nature of the Clegg Hammer test The BB also measures on the basis of a,
