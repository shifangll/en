## Niobium
Niobium was discovered in 1801 by Charles Hatchett in an ore sent to England more that a century earlier.Hatchett named the element columbium (symbol Cb).In 1846 Henrich Rose independently discovered the element and named it Niobium.The metal was first.Metalcess works for metal cycle from ore extraction to …Metalcess focuses on ore beneficiation,metallurgy,metals recycling.We works with the client for the whole metal lifecycle from ore extraction to recycling!
