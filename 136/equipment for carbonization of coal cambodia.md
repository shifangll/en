## Carbonization Wikipedia
Carbonization is a pyrolytic reaction,therefore,is considered a complex process in which many reactions take place concurrently such as dehydrogenation,condensation,hydrogen transfer and isomerization.Carbonization differs from coalifiion in that it occurs much faster,due to its reaction rate being faster by many orders of magnitude.Biomass Briquettes Production and Marketing energypedia.info21 Aug 2017.6.1 Cambodia Sustainable Green Fuel Enterprise (SGFE); 6.2 Kenya Chardust Ltd.6.3 India Biomass Urja Kotdwar; 6.4 Zambia Emerging.Coal became dominant in the late 19th century before being overtaken by petroleum products in the middle of the last century,a time when natural gas usage&nbsp;.
