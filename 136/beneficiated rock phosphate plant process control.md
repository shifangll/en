## Phosphorite
Phosphorite,phosphate rock or rock phosphate is a non detrital sedimentary rock that contains high amounts of phosphate minerals.The phosphate content of phosphorite (or grade of phosphate rock) varies greatly,from 4%[1] to 20% phosphorus pentoxide (P2O5).Marketed phosphate rock is enriched (&quot;beneficiated&quot;) to at least 28%,often more than.RSMMLBeneficiation Looking to the scarce rock phosphate resources in India,RSMML has put continuous effort for utilization of its low grade ore resources,which are abundant at Jhamarkotra but require beneficiation before its utilization by fertiliser industries as raw material.
