Like the pale angle of timeAnd eternity.The great shape labored and fell.” —N.Scott Momaday (b.1934) “ The competent leader of men cares little for the niceties of other peoples’ characters: he cares much—everything—for the exterior uses to which they may be put.IndexThe relationship between friction angle and dilation angle is linear (figure 4,for example).(8) The y intercept of the best fit linear envelope in the ZDA approach is the proposed design friction angle at peak conditions for a particular aggregate (table 2),which
