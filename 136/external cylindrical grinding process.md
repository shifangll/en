## Centerless grinding
Centerless grinding is a machining process that uses abrasive cutting to remove material from a workpiece.[1] Centerless grinding differs from centered grinding operations in that no spindle or fixture is used to locate and secure the workpiece;[2] the workpiece is secured between two rotary grinding wheels,and the speed of their rotation.Internal Cylindrical Grinding Machines UNITED GRINDINGFritz STUDER AG was formed in 1912 and manufactures grinding machines for internal and external cylindrical grinding for small and middle sized work pieces.Our strength lies in single,small and middle sized job lots mainly for the markets of machine tooling
