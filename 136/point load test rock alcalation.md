## Correlation of rock strength between uniaxial compressive,
BTS test is performed by compressing a sample between two curved loading jaws as shown in Figure 2 b) Point load on the other hand,is performed manually by compressing a sample between two conical steel platens as shown in Figure 3 In order to achieve that,a literature review was conducted to understand rock behaviour under the influence of.Point load test (PLT)Point load test (PLT) The Point load test is an index test by which the rock is classified according to the strength.The test can be used to estimate other characteristics of intact rocks with which it correlates,such as uniaxial compressive and tensile strength.The.

## Standard Test Method for Determination of the Point Load,
53 This test method is performed to determine the point load strength index of rock specimens and,if required,the point load strength anisotropy index 54 Rock specimens in the form of either core (the diametral and axial tests),cut blocks (the block test),or irregular lumps (the irregular lump test) are tested by application of concentrated load through a pair of truncated,conical platens
