SAG mills use larger pieces of ore to break up the smaller pieces (autogenous — does it by itself).The larger pieces break down as well.To help the process along,eightinchdiameter steel balls are added to the rocks as they tumble inside the rotating mill (semiautogenous — gets some help from the steel balls).The two&nbspMilling and Processing How Uranium Mining Works HowStuffWorksAt the mill,uranium ore undergoes a variety of changes to turn it into a finished product: uranium powder,also known as yellowcake.The milling process is so important that the U.S.Atomic Energy Commission has helped mines establish mills close by to make it easier to process uranium ore and quicken the production of&nbsp

## How Is Gold Processed? Reference
Heap leaching is a less expensive method of gold extraction,but it is a longer process and it recovers less gold than the cyanide milling process.Gold mining teams include geologists who analyze rock structure to guide mining explorations,engineers who plan extraction and blasting strategies,and miners who do the work of removing the oreRoseberyRosebery is approximately 300 kilometres north west of Hobart and 125 kilometres south of Burnie.Rosebery is 100% owned by MMG Limited and has been operating continually for over 80 years,with operations starting in 1936.Zinc,copper and lead concentrates.

## The ABC of Mine to Mill and metal price cycles AusIMM Bulletin
An excellent summary of the steps involved in any Mine to Mill project sorts them into three main areas (McKee,2013):.Good data needs to be collected about the ore before it is mined and as it passes through the production chain,the equipment and processes used in production and the process performance and cost.
