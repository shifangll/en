## What is Smelting? (with pictures)
&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;Smelting is a process for extracting usable ore from mixed deposits where people find ore bound with other metals,rock,and extraneous material.It is very unusual to find deposits of pure ore and this method allows people to separate out useful metals.The invention of this process was an.Iron Smelting 101 Harald the SmithOne of my specialties as artisan,research and demonstrator is bloomery iron smelting.An ancient method of iron production,which consists of gathering iron ore and then smelting it in a clay shaft full of burning charcoal.The result is called a ‘bloom’ a spongy.

## What is Smelting?,and Iron ore Smelting process
What is iron smelting? Smelting is production of metal,especially iron,from ore in a process that involves melting and chemical reduction of metal compounds into purified metal.or Any of the various liquids or semi molten solids produced and used during thesmelting Definition &amp; Facts BritannicaIn modern ore treatment,various preliminary steps are usually carried out before smelting in order to concentrate the metal ore as much as possible.In the smelting process a metal that is combined with oxygen—for example,iron oxide—is heated to a high temperature,and the oxide is caused to combine with the carbon in the fuel,escaping as carbon monoxide or carbon dioxide.

## Smelting
Smelting is a process of applying heat to ore in order to extract out a base metal.It is a form of extractive metallurgy.It is used to extract many metals from their ores,including silver,iron,copper,and other base metals.Smelting uses heat and a chemical reducing agent to decompose the ore,driving off other elements as gases or slag and leaving the metal base behind.Smelting ProcessSmeting Process Our special smelting process extracts three value products from the ore,namely,High Purity Iron,Vanadium Slag and Titanium Slag.It is mainly a three stage reduction converting atomizing process.Mined ore is crushed to size.
