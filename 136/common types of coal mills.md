A mill is a device that breaks solid materials into smaller pieces by grinding,crushing,or cutting.Such comminution is an important unit operation in many processes.There are many different types of mills and many types of materials processed in them.Historically mills were powered by hand (e.g.via a hand crank),working animal (e.g.horse mill),wind or water ().Mining health and safety: 7 common risks to protect.&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;“Understanding and being aware of your environment is the first step to preventing illness or injury in the workplace,” reveals mining medicine researcher Megan Clark,who outlines the following 7 common health risks to watch out for in the mining industry.1.Coal dust.Dus
