## Calcium carbonate CaCO3
Calcium Carbonate is the carbonic salt of calcium (CaCO3).Calcium carbonate is used therapeutically as a phosphate buffer in hemodialysis,as an antacid in gastric hyperacidity for temporary relief of indigestion and heartburn,and as a calcium supplement for preventing and treating osteoporosis.Calcium carbonateCalcium carbonate (limestone) is heated to form calcium oxide (quicklime) and carbon dioxide: It is an endothermic reaction and the equilibrium lies far to the left at low temperatures.Only at about 1200 K does the partial pressure of carbon dioxide exceed atmospheric pressure and the decomposition proceeds to completion.
