## Steelmaking
Steelmaking is the process of producing steel from iron ore and or scrap.In steelmaking,impurities such as nitrogen,silicon,phosphorus,sulfur and excess carbon (most important impurity) are removed from the sourced iron,and alloying elements such as manganese,nickel,chromium,carbon and vanadium are added to produce different grades of steel.How Much CO2 Gets Emitted to Build a Wind Turbine? …So,in comparison,how much CO2 gets emitted when building a skyscraper,say like the CN tower in Toronto ?
