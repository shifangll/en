## Phosphate
The phosphate ion is a polyatomic ion with the empirical formula (PO4) 3− and a molar mass of 94.97 g mol.It consists of one central phosphorus atom surrounded by four oxygen atoms in a tetrahedral arrangement.The phosphate ion carries a −3 formal charge and is the conjugate base of the hydrogen phosphate ion,H(PO.PhosphateIn chemistry,a phosphate is an anion,salt,functional group or ester derived from a phosphoric acid.It most commonly means orthophosphate,a derivative of orthophosphoric acid H 3PO 4.The phosphate or orthophosphate ion [PO 4]3− is derived from phosphoric acid by the removal of three protons H+.Removal of one or two protons gives the.
