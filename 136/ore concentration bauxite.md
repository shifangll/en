## The significance of leaching in the extraction of toppr.com
Bauxite is the principal ore of aluminium.The impurities present in bauxite are SiO2,iron oxides and titanium oxide (TiO2).Al2O3 is extracted out as sodium aluminate.The impurity,SiO2 too dissolves forming sodium silicate.Other impurities are left behind.Bayer processThe Bayer process is the principal industrial means of refining bauxite to produce alumina (aluminium oxide) and was developed by Carl Josef Bayer.Bauxite,the most important ore of aluminium,contains only 30 60% aluminium oxide (Al 2 O 3),the rest being a mixture of silica,various iron oxides,and titanium dioxide.
