## What are the design considerations for dowel bars in joints …
The behaviour of dowel bars resembles that of piles in soils subject to lateral loads.Failure of the joint occurs by yielding of steel under bending action or by crushing of concrete due to bearing stresses.In general,the spacing of dowel bars should not be too close.Shear Resistance Capacity of Interface of Plate Studs …The local compression bearing capacity of the concrete at the top of the vertical steel plate is calculated as follows: where is the action area of the local pressure and is the local compressive strength coefficient of the concrete,considered to be 1.5.
