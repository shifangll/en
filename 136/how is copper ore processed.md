## Copper processing
Extraction and refining The extraction of copper from ore is normally carried out in three major steps.The first step,mineral processing,is to liberate the copper minerals and remove waste constituents—such as alumina,limestone,pyrite,and silica—so that the copper minerals and other nonferrous minerals of value are concentrated into a product containing between 20 and 30 percent copper.Copper: How it is Sold and Priced MarketCapCopper concentrates are produced by the beneficiation,or upgrading,of copper ore A typical copper ore would be 07% to 2% copper,a typical copper concentrate would grade around 25% to 35% copper Copper concentrates are either smelted and refined in house,or sold to custom smelters The concentrate may be smelted to produce blister copper.

Copper processing is a complex process that involves many steps as the manufacturer processes the ore from its raw,mined state into a purified form for use in many industries.Copper is typically extracted from oxide and sulfide ores that contain between 0.5 and 2.0% copper.Chapter 7 Energy Use in the Copper IndustryMINERAL PROCESSING Grinding and concentration together consume about 45 percent of the energy used in the pro duction of cathode copper Assuming an ore grade of 055 percent and a recovery rate of875 64 percent copper in the concentrate,concentrat ing 1 ton of copper ore requires over 200 billion Btu,or approximately 42 million Btu ton of.

At some Australian mines,the copper is leached from the ore to produce a copper rich solution which is later treated to recover the copper metal.The ore is first broken and set out on leach pads where it is dissolved by a sulfuric acid solution to leach out theWhat Is Copper Smelting? (with pictures) Info BloomSmall nuggets of pure copper A typical process might begin with grinding of the ore into a powder This powder is processed with chemicals and air to separate out some of the unwanted material and concentrate the copper Unwanted material from this step is referred to as the tailings The tailings are typically disposed of in a tailings pond
