## Zinc: smelting,producing and classification Metalpedia
Zinc smelting is the process of converting zinc concentrates (ores that contain zinc) into pure zinc.The most common zinc concentrate processed is zinc sulfide,which is obtained by concentrating sphalerite using the froth flotation method.There are two methods of.11.23 Taconite Ore ProcessingThe average iron content of pellets is 63 percent.11.23.2 Process Description 5,41 Processing of taconite consists of crushing and grinding the ore to liberate iron bearing particles,concentrating the ore by separating the particles from the waste material
