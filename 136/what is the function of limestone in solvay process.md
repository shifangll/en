## Solvay process
The Solvay process is an industrial process,also known as the ammonia soda process,for the manufacture of sodium carbonate (see sodium).Sodium chloride (common salt),ammonia,carbon dioxide,and water react to give precipitated sodium bicarbonate,which on heating gives sodium carbonate and carbon dioxide for recycling.Calcium carbonateCalcium carbonate is a chemical compound with the formula Ca CO 3.It is a common substance found in rocks as the minerals calcite and aragonite (most notably as limestone,which is a type of sedimentary rock consisting mainly of calcite) and is the main component of pearls and the shells of marine organisms,snails,and eggs.and eggs.
