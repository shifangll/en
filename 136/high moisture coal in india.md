## Coal
Coal is a combustible black or brownish black sedimentary rock,formed as rock strata called coal seams.Coal is mostly carbon with variable amounts of other elements; chiefly hydrogen,sulfur,oxygen,and nitrogen.[1] Coal is formed when dead plant matter decays into peat and is converted into coal by the heat and pressure of deep burial over.Indian coal reserves: Classification of coal and where it is …Coal is the main source of energy in India as it fulfils almost 67 per cent of the total commercial energy consumed in the country.This fossil fuel is found in a form of sedimentary rocks and is often known as 'Black Gold'.It is originated from organic matter wood.
