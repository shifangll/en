## Energy Efficiency and Saving in the Cement Industry,
Portland cement,the most widely used cement type,contains 95% cement clinker Large amounts of electricity are used grinding the raw materials and finished cement The clinker making process also emits CO 2 as a by product during the calcination of limestoneTypes Of Cement and Their Uses In Construction Daily CivilTypes of cement: Rapid hardening cement,Low heat cement,Sulphate resisting cement,White cement,Hydrophobic cement,portland blast cement,etc,Hydrophobic cement is manufactured by adding water repellant chemicals to ordinary portland cement in the process of grinding,the normal cement clinkers are mixed with up to 65% of the blast.
