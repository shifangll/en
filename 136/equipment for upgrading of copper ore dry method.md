## The Extraction of Copper
The method used to extract copper from its ores depends on the nature of the ore.Sulfide ores such as chalcopyrite (\(CuFeS 2\)) are converted to copper by a different method from silicate,carbonate or sulfate ores.Chalcopyrite (also known as copper pyrites) and similar sulfide ores are the commonest ores of copper…Associate Professor James VaughanBiography: Associate Professor James Vaughan is head of the Hydrometallurgy Research Group at the University of Queensland within the School of Chemical Engineering.He obtained a Bachelor’s degree in Metallurgical Engineering at McGill University followed by Master of Applied Science and PhD degrees in Materials Engineering at The University of British Columbia.
