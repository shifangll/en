## Iron ore extraction techniques
Iron ore was won by drilling and blasting ().As mining technology generally developed,so did drilling techniques and the explosives used.Smith (1990) reported that the Cleveland deposit was associated with a very strong stone roof rock (known as “dogger”) allowing mine drivages to be self supporting.Iron Extraction ProcessIron Extraction Process In the blast furnace process,the first step on the way towards heavy plate,pig iron is produced from iron ore.The composition of the ore and additions is accurately adjusted to the final products of AG der Dillinger H&#252;ttenwerke and Saarstahl
