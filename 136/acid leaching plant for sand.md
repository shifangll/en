## Acid Rain Effects Soils
Acid deposition adds hydrogen ions,which displace these important nutrients in a process called leaching Leaching means that the ions are washed deeper into the subsoil or washed out of the top soil If ions are leached from the soil,they are no longer available to the roots of the plantsIon Exchange in Soil: Cation and AnionThe loosely held K + ions are more readily available for absorption by plants or for leaching in acid soils There are also some nutrient “antagonisms”,which in certain soil cause inhibition of uptake of some cations by plants Thus,potassium uptake by plants is limited by high levels of calcium in some soils

Feb 01,2009&#0183;&#32;The primary advantage of using oxalic acid is in the formation during leaching of soluble complexes that are both photochemically and microbiologically degradable In this study,chemical leaching and bioleaching methods were used for quartz sand Using the ANOVA Yates test technique,the effects of solids rate,temperature and oxalic acid rate were investigated using chemical leaching.1998 Physical Separation and Acid Leaching a Demonstration,Acid Leaching Acid leaching belongs to a group of techniques called soil washing,which tries to mobilize the target metals from the soil into a solution The solution is then treated to recover the metals in a concentrated form for off site disposal or recycling Acid leaching aims to solubilize metals from the soil by changing the pH
