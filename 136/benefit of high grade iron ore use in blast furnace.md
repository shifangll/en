## What is the size of iron ore which feeded in a blast …
Both the collapsed answers that it ranges from 10 mm to 30 mm are correct.However a little elaboration would be useful.For proper blast to be maintained there should be sufficient space between pieces of iron ore.Therefore the ore should not be.Iron Essential Chemical IndustryThe blast furnace uses either high grade iron ore or the iron ore pellets together with coke and limestone In a modern blast furnace,the mass of each component and the timing of its addition to the furnace are computer controlled,responding automatically to the conditions prevailing at,

## Blast furnace
A blast furnace is a type of metallurgical furnace used for smelting to produce industrial metals,generally pig iron,but also others such as lead or copper.Blast refers to the combustion air being &quot;forced&quot; or supplied above atmospheric pressure.[1] In a blast furnace,fuel (coke),ores,and flux (limestone) are continuously supplied through.Zinc processing&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;Zinc processing Zinc processing The zinc lead blast furnace: Sintered zinc and lead concentrates,mixed with metallurgical coke,are charged into the top of a shaft furnace,into which preheated air is blown through nozzles,or tuyeres,at the base (see figure).

## Blast Furnace Charge (Raw Materials for Steel making)
1.QUALITY OF CHARGE MATERIAL: A blast furnace charge consists of coke,ore or sinter,and limestone.These materials must be in lumps of a certain size ( 60 mm).Larger lumps prolong the process of reduction and fluxing.Smaller lumps block the flue gas passages and prevent a uniform descent of melting materials in the furnace.2.IRON ORES: Ore is a metal bearing mineral.The most.Our iron ore pellets for purer steelThe use of pellets instead of sinter in our customers' crude iron processes further reduces emissions,as sintering is not required at the steelworks.The raw material from LKAB is already prepared for use in the blast furnace.The high concentration of iron in
