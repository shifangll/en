## Pharmaceutical technology: June 2013
Combined impact and attrition methods •A ball mill,fluid energy mills and pin mills are examples of a comminuting method which produces size reduction by both impact and attrition of particles.Equipments •All milling or Comminution equipment have three basic components: 1.A structure for feeding material to the mill.Compare and Understand Rod Ball Impact Crushing Abrasion.The dominant mechanisms of comminution are very different in the two tests (the crushing test is mostly measuring impact crushing strength of fractures in the rock,whereas the ball mill test is measuring the abrasion strength of the matrix of a rock and the attrition resistance of individual grains within the rock).
