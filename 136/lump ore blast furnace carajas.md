Iron ore pellet is a type of agglomerated iron ore fines which has better tumbler index when compared with that of parent iron ore and can be used as a substitute of lump ore for the production of direct reduced iron (DRI) and in blast furnaces for the production of hot metalLump Ore and Sinter Behaviour during Softening and Meltingas the lump ore level is increased These findings indicate that there is significant interaction between the material types in the test and that results from single material tests should not be used in isolation assess material performance in a blast furnace Any prejudice against lump ores as a blast furnace,
