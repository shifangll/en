## The Basics of Pre Treatment
Purpose of Pretreatment ! To help make paint adhere to metal ! Make a painted surface last longer ! Enhance rust and corrosion resistance of metal ! Metal needs to be clean to allow good paint adhesion ! Good paint adhesion ensures long life of the painted surfaceWhy does Titania (TiO2) turn blue?Why does Titania (TiO2) turn blue? I am milling TiO2 in ball mill using alumina jar and zirconia balls.As I grind the material in ball mill even for an hour its colour turns permanently to light.
