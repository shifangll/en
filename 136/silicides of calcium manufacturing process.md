## Calcium Carbide and Acetylene manufacturing process
Problems of calcium carbide manufacturing process Calcium carbide plant causes to environmental pollution.Corol and limestone are used to take CaO.This causes to coastal erosion.Energy required for preparing CaC 2 is higher than getting energy by the combustion of C 2 H 2.SilicideA silicide is a compound that has silicon with (usually) more electropositive elements.Silicon is more electropositive than carbon.Silicides are structurally closer to borides than to carbides.Similar to borides and carbides,the composition of silicides cannot be easily.
