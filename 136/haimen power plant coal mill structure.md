## Modeling and Control of Coal Mill
Coal mill is an important component of the thermal power pla nt.It is used to grind and dry the moisturized raw coal and transport the pulverized coal &#177; air mixture to the boiler.Poor dynamic performance of coal mill will lead to decrease in the overall efficiency of the power plant,slow load take up rate and fr equent shut down.Overview of Thermal Power Plants&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;• A thermal power plant burns enormous amounts of coal.•A 200MW plant may require around 2000 tons of coal daily 8.Pulverising plant In modern thermal power plant,coal is pulverised i.e.ground to dust like size and carried to the furnace in a stream of hot air.

## Modelling and start up optimization of a coal fired power.
The operation of thermal power plants is therefore changing in several ways,one of which is an increasing number of start ups per year.The start up of the German lignite power plant J&#228;nschwalde is examined in this thesis.A simpliﬁed model of the plant is developed and a start up scenario is con sidered.How Does a Coal Power Plant Work?Thermal based power plants can produce electricity from coal or other fuel sources.The coal fired process requires three different steps to turn energy released from burning coal to generating electricity for consumption.Coal fired power plants,while producing power,require a lot of water an
