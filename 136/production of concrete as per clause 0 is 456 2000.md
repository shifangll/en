## Seismic Performance of Lightweight Concrete Structures
Concrete structures are prone to earthquake due to mass of the structures.The primary use of structural lightweight concrete (SLWC) is to reduce the dead load of a concrete structure,which allows the structural designer to reduce the size of the structural members like beam,column,and footings which results in reduction of earthquake forces on the structure.This paper attempts to predict.Experimental Investigation on Behavior of Reinforced Concrete …as per code IS 456:2000,cl.26.5.1.6.The development length of the tension and compression rods in beam were also provided as per clause 26.2.1 of code IS 456:2000.The lateral ties in the columns of the specimens C3 consisted of 8 mm diameter bar at 75
