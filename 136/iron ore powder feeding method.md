## Ore Blending
About ore blending &amp; stockpiles: Since the function of the stockpile is to act as an ore reservoir rather than as an ore processor,the action of forming a stockpile should have as little effect as possible on the material.Several undesirable effects are produced by.Coke (fuel)Coke is a grey,hard,and porous fuel with a high carbon content and few impurities,made by heating coal or oil in the absence of air—a destructive distillation process.It is an important industrial product,used mainly in iron ore smelting,but also as a fuel in stoves and forges when air pollution is a concern.

## How iron is made
Iron ore is converted into various types of iron through several processes.The most common process is the use of a blast furnace to produce pig iron which is about 94% iron and 5% carbon with smaller amounts of other elements.Angle of ReposeAngle of repose is another important physical property used for characterization of the bulk of particulate foods such as seeds,grains,flours,grits,and fruits.When granular solids are piled on a flat surface,the sides of the pile are at a definite reproducible angle with.

## Direct reduced iron
Direct reduced iron (DRI),also called sponge iron,[1] is produced from the direct reduction of iron ore (in the form of lumps,pellets,or fines) to iron by a reducing gas or elemental carbon produced from natural gas or coal.Many ores are suitable for direct reduction.Direct reduction refers to solid state processes which reduce iron.(PDF) Coating of iron oxide pellets for direct reductionIn the case of iron ore pellets,while the generation of coarse fragments may not have negative implications as losses to the steelmaking plant,since they would not be removed from the feed of.
