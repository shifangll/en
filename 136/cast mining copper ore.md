## Processes
Copper Mining The following gives an overview of how copper is extracted from its ore and converted into pure metal.Mining The ore is removed from the ground in either open pit or underground mines.Underground sinking a vertical shaft into the earth to reachBasics of an open pit mineOpen pit mines can be used in coal mining,and they are used extensively in &quot;hard rock&quot; mining for ores such as metal ores,copper,gold,iron,aluminum,and many minerals.In a open pit coal mine,the pit bottom would be the bottom mined coal seam elevation,since it is usually feasible to extract multiple seams when surface mining coal.
