## Sand Equivalents Quality in California
So if your sample has a 90 sand equivalent that means that 90% of the sample was good material and 10% was detrimental.If you have a 40 sand equivalent that means that 40% of the sample was good material and 60% was detrimental.Many materials such as concrete sands will have high SEs,in the 80s or 90s but it is very rare to see a 100 SE.Utilise new technology to develop a test for determining the quality.Hveem developed the (California) sand equivalent test based on Californian materials and although predominantly for concrete aggregates and natural sands also provided proposed SE values for bases and bituminous mixes (refer to Table 1).The work was quickly followed by research conducted by suggesting SE limits&nbsp;.

## Sand equivalent test Wikipedia
The sand equivalent test quantifies the relative abundance of sand versus clay in soil.It is measured by standardized test methods such as ASTM D2419,AASHTO T176,and EN 933 8.The test is used to qualify aggregates for applications where sand is desirable but fines and dust are not.A higher sand equivalent value&nbsp;.ASSESSING THE CLEANLINESS OF FINE AGGREGATES USING.As a result,in specifying aggregate gradation limits,ASTM C33 allows a.Currently,the sand equivalency test aims to estimate the impact of cleanliness.This.An ASTM Type I II ordinary Portland cement (OPC) with an alkali equivalent.
