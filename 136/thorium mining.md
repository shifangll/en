Mining lunar thorium gains you nothing.Thorium is not fissile and cannot be used to fuel a nuclear rocket,power plant,or RTG.Designs for &quot;Thorium&quot; nuclear power plants use thorium as a fertile material to breed fissile U 233 using the neutrons from a fission reaction fueled by fissile U 235 or U 233.You start with a fairly&nbsp;.Thorium Ore Vanilla WoW Wiki FandomThorium OreItem Level 40Disenchants into:Not disenchantableSell Price: 250 Thorium Ore is mined from various Thorium veins,with a minimum mining skill of 230.This rare metal combines the weight of lead with the strength of steel.Orcs prize it for weapons

14 Feb 2012.The Fukushima disaster reminded us all of the dangers inherent in uranium fueled nuclear reactors.Fresh news yesterday about Tepco&#39;s continued struggle to contain and cool the fuel rods highlights just how energetic uranium fission reactions are and how challenging to control.Of course,that level of&nbsp;.Thorium World Nuclear AssociationThorium is much more abundant in nature than uranium.Thorium can be used as a nuclear fuel through breeding to uranium 233 (U 233).When this thorium fuel cycle is used,much less plutonium and other transuranic elements are produced,compared with uranium fuel cycles.Several thorium fuelled reactor concepts&nbsp;.
