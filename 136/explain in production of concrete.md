## 11.6 Portland Cement Manufacturing
11.6 Portland Cement Manufacturing 11.6.1 Process Description 7 Portland cement is a fine powder,gray or white in color,that consists of a mixture of hydraulic cement materials comprising primarily calcium silicates,aluminates and aluminoferrites.More than 30.What is curing of concrete?Curing is the process by which fresh wet concrete is allowed to complete its reaction to attain its planned strength.Concrete is a mix of cement,water,sand and stone aggregate.Note that the proportions of these ingredients are calculated as pe.

## Portland cement
Portland cement is the most common type of cement in general use around the world as a basic ingredient of concrete,mortar,stucco,and non specialty grout.It was developed from other types of hydraulic lime in England in the early 19th century by Joseph Aspdin,and …Concrete: Manufacturing ProcessConsiderable quantity of air is entrapped in concrete during its production and there is possible partial segregation also.Both of these adversely affect the quality of concrete.Compaction of the concrete is the process to get rid of the entrapped air and voids
