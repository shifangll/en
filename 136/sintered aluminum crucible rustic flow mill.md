## US5242872A
A process for producing a sintered body of aluminum nitride,which comprises mixing an aluminum nitride powder with (A) an alkaline earth metal aluminate,or both of (A ) an oxide or oxide forming compound of aluminum,and (A ) an oxide or oxide forming.Sintered Aluminum Powder (SAP)Sintered aluminum powder alloys have properties quite different from those of material fabricated by conventional techniques.The oxide that forms immediately on the surface of aluminum is not reduced back to metal during sintering and the resulting powder pro

## How Is Sheet Metal Made? Sciencing
Sheet metal can be made from a variety of different metals including aluminum,steel,copper,brass,nickel,tin,sterling silver and titanium.No matter what type of metal is used,the first step is toNitridingNitriding is a heat treating process that diffuses nitrogen into the surface of a metal to create a case hardened surface.These processes are most commonly used on low carbon,low alloy steels.They are also used on medium and high carbon steels,titanium,aluminium and molybdenum.In 2015,nitriding was used to generate unique duplex.

## Ceramic
A ceramic material is an inorganic,non metallic,often crystalline oxide,nitride or carbide material.Some elements,such as carbon or silicon,may be considered ceramics.Ceramic materials are brittle,hard,strong in compression,and weak in shearing and tension.and tension.Development of New High Purity Aluminaparticle size distribution.A ball mill,vibration mill,jet mill,media agitating mill or other type of mill can be used for the deagglomeration process.In alumina ceramics applications,the presence of the agglomerates gives rise to local nonuniformity in a green body,and it causes residual pores in a sintered body.
