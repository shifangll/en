## Cement mill
A cement mill (or finish mill in North American usage) is the equipment used to grind the hard,nodular clinker from the cement kiln into the fine grey powder that is cement.Most cement is currently ground in ball mills and also vertical roller mills which are more eOpen and closed circuit dry grinding of cement mill.In this study,separator rejects of a closed circuit cement tube milling were dry ground in a 10 l pilot scale vertical stirred mill.Tests were done as open and closed circuit.The results were evaluated by size distributions,Blaine surface are
