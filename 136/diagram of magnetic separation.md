## Magnetic separation
Carrier magnetic separation has been proposed for more effective separation of water and solids from acid mine water to generate very pure water (Feng et al.2000).As discussed in Chapter 10,dissolved heavy metals like zinc and copper can be recovered from acid mine drainage (AMD) by selective precipitation controlling the pH for the precipitation of specific metals.Magnetic Separation in the Mining IndustryMagnetic separation definitely is one of the most important parts of this process.I think magnetic separators are often taken for granted when it comes to processing,whether that processing is in mining or in food processing.Many people don’t even know the work
