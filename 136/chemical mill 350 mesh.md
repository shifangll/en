## Mesh (scale)
Mesh is a measurement of particle size often used in determining the particle size distribution of a granular material.For example,a sample from a truckload of peanuts may be placed atop a mesh with 5 mm openings.When the mesh is shaken,small broken pieces and dust pass through the mesh while whole peanuts are retained on the mesh.A.M Series Fine GrinderPrater Fine Grinders (M Series Mills) are designed to grind dry,free flowing material as fine as 200 mesh (75 microns) with very tight distribution of particle size.The highly efficient design allows for ease of access to all internals and is well suited for heat sensitive.
