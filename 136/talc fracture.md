## Talc — Wikip&#233;dia
Le talc est une esp&#232;ce min&#233;rale compos&#233;e de silicate de magn&#233;sium doublement hydroxyl&#233; de formule Mg3Si4O10(OH)2,pouvant contenir des traces de nickel,de fer,d'aluminium,de calcium,de sodium et d'autres silicates magn&#233;siens comme l'amiante.Fault gougeFault gouge is a tectonite (a rock formed by tectonic forces) with a very small grain size.Fault gouge has no cohesion and it is normally an unconsolidated rock type,unless cementation took place at a later stage.A fault gouge forms in the same way as fault breccia,the latter also having larger clasts.[1] In comparison to fault breccia.

This was reflected in the fracture surface of talc reinforced low crystallinity polypropylene (T1).Fig.8 shows the low and high magnification SEM micrographs of the fracture surface of T1 illustrating different modes of fracture.Two types of fracture morphology wereMelt FractureMelt fracture is a type of flow instability that begins as a roughening of the surface (shark skin) and at higher output can lead to severe distortion of the polymer.PPAs help extend the critical shear rate at which melt fracture occurs,allowing higher line speeds.
