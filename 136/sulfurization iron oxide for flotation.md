## sulfurization iron oxide for flotation
The Effect of Sulfurization Process on Flotation of,With the depleting reserves of high grade iron ore in the world,froth flotation has become increasingly important to process intermediate and low grade iron ore in an attempt to meet the rapidly,sulfurization iron oxide for flotation MC WorldChen Jinquan et al Carried out sulfurization amine salt flotation test on a high speed iron slime lead zinc oxide mine Using sodium sulfide as sulfurizer and mixed amines (dodecylamine,cetylamine and octadecylamine) as collector,under the conditions of lead zinc feed grade of 354% and 586%,the flotation indexes of lead concentrate grade.
