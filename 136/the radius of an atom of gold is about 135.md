## Atom
The radius of a nucleus is approximately equal to 1.07 3 √ A fm,where A is the total number of nucleons.This is much smaller than the radius of the atom,which is on the order of 10 5 fm.The nucleons are bound together by a short ranged attractive potential.The radius of an atom of gold (Au) is about 135 &#197; How,Two radius of an atom is equal to the diameter Adding up all the diameter of the atoms,it should be equal to 95 mm Therefore,we simply convert the units to the same units then divide 135 A to 95 mm
