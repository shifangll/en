## Crushing Concrete Cube or Cylinder at 28 days
The crushing of concrete cubes or cylinder samples is required in a construction especially concrete structures.The reason why this is to verify the strength given in the design mix.Let say for example for a concrete column commonly it has 60 megapascals of specified strength.When you crush it,the result should be equal or more than 60 Mpa.The specified strength should be achieved at 28.What is the difference between crushing strength and …CRUSHING STRENGTH IS THE ULTIMATE STRESS DURING COMPRESSIVE TEST.IT IS A DAMAGING STRESS,SINCE THE MATERIAL IS ALLOWED TO FRACTURE WHILE TESTING.COMPRESSIVE STRENGTH IS A FAILURE STRESS,WITH

## Concrete Compressive Strength
Concrete compressive strength does not depend on the full hydration of its cement particles but essentially on their closeness.10,11 In a concrete having a water cement ratio lower than 0.42,hydration stops when there is no more water to hydrate the cement particles.Acceptance testing and criteria for ready mixed concrete in Hong …18 General Specification for Civil Engineering Works: 2006 • Acceptance testing and criteria given in Clauses 16.58 to 16.62 • Clause 16.59 • 2 cubes shall be made in accordance to CS1 • Test result = average compressive strength of each pair of cubes made from
