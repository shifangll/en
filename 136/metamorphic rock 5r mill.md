## What are metamorphic rocks?
Metamorphic rocks started out as some other type of rock,but have been substantially changed from their original igneous,sedimentary,or earlier metamorphic form.Metamorphic rocks form when rocks are subjected to high heat,high pressure,hot mineral rich fluids or,more commonly,some combination of these factors.Metamorphic Rocks Pictures of Foliated and Non Foliated.Metamorphic rock,any rock that results from the alteration of preexisting rocks in response to changing conditions,such as variations in temperature,pressure,and mechanical stress,and the addition or subtraction of chemical components.The preexisting rocks may be igneous,sedimentary,or other metamorphic rocks.

## Metamorphic rock
Metamorphic rocks arise from the transformation of existing rock types,in a process called metamorphism,which means &quot;change in form&quot;.The original rock is subjected to heat (temperatures greater than 150 to 200 &#176;C) and pressure (100 megapascals (1,000 bar) or more),causing profound physical or chemical change.The protolith may be a sedimentary,igneous,or existing metamorphic rock.
