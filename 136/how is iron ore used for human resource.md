## Iron in the Industrial Revolution
While Britain had good iron ore reserves,the iron produced was of low quality with plenty of impurities,limiting its use.There was plenty of demand but not much was produced as wrought iron,which had many of the impurities hammered out,took a long time to make,and was available in cheaper imports from Scandinavia.Iron Geoscience AustraliaAbout 98% of world iron ore production is used to make iron in the form of steel.Iron in cast form has many specific uses (e.g.pipes,fittings,engine blocks) but pure iron is quite soft.Adding a small amount of carbon (usually less than 1%) makes iron into steel
