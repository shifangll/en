The &quot;International Cyanide Management Code For the Manufacture,Transport,and Use of Cyanide In the Production of Gold&quot; (Cyanide Code) was developed by a multi stakeholder Steering Committee under the guidance of the United Nations Environmental Program (UNEP) and the then International Council on Metals and the Environment (ICME).What is Gold Cyanidation? (with picture)&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;Gold cyanidation,also called cyanide leaching,is a process used to extract gold from raw ore taken from the ground.It uses cyanide to dissolve the gold within the rock,which,itself,is not soluble in cyanide.The gold is then drawn out in a liquid form that can be treated to remove the cyanide.
