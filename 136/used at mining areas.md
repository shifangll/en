Mining Mining Underground mining: When any ore body lies a considerable distance below the surface,the amount of waste that has to be removed in order to uncover the ore through surface mining becomes prohibitive,and underground techniques must be considered.Counting against underground mining are the costs,which,for each ton of material mined,are much higher underground than on the.Gold miningFor example,gold mining activities in tropical forests are increasingly causing deforestation along rivers and in remote areas rich in biodiversity.[18] [19] Other gold mining impacts,particularly in aquatic systems with residual cyanide or mercury (used in the recovery of gold from ore),can be highly toxic to people and wildlife even at relatively low concentrations.
