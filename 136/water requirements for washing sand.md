## Cement Standards and Concrete Standards
ASTM cement standards and concrete standards contain specifications and test methods to determine the properties of concrete,hydraulic cements,and aggregates.ASTM's cement and concrete standards are instrumental in the evaluation and testing of concrete.Sand FilterSand filters use either graded sand (fine to coarse or heterogeneous) or coarse monograde sand (uniform size or homogeneous).No single media specification (size and depth) can be applied universally for all waters; the choice depends on the water quality and upstream processes,filtered water quality objectives,cleaning method,filtration rate and length of filter runs.
