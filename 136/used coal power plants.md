## Fossil fuel power station Wikipedia
Power plants generally use steam coal which is a grade between anthracite and bituminous Coal is first milled to a fine powder,which increases the surface area and allows it to burn more quickly In these pulverized coal combustion systems,the powdered coal is blown into the combustion chamber of a boiler where it is burnt at high temperatureCoal fired power plants (Wisconsin Public Service)Coal fired power plants burn coal to produce heat A boiler uses that heat to convert water into steam The steam,at high pressure,flows from the boiler to a turbine generator,where the,
