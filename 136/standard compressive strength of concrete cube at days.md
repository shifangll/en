## Why We Test Concrete Compressive Strength after 28 …
Why do we test concrete compressive strength after 28 days? Concrete gains strength with time after casting.It takes much time for concrete to gain 100% strength and the time for same is still unknown.The rate of gain of concrete compressive strength in higherStrength of Concrete4&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;where mean compressive strength at age days 1 28.the compressive strength of concrete is a 6 12.Standard: Specimen must be in moist condition at the time of testing.Air dried specimens show 20 to 25% higher strength than corresponding saturated specimen.

## What is the 7 days and 28 days strength of a cube test.
This is also called as compressive strength.For example: Suppose at a bridge site pile is being cast so to ensure that the concrete used is of designed strength or not,we take concrete cubes of size 150*150*150 mm to test strength of concrete.Strength of CementSince cement gains strength over time,the time at which strength test is to be conducted must be specified.Typically times are 1 day (for high early strength cement),3 days,7 days,28 days and 90 days (for low heat of hydration cement).

## Compressive Strength of Concrete
The compressive strength of concrete is given in terms of the characteristic compressive strength of 150 mm size cubes tested at 28 days (f ck) as per Indian Standards (ACI standards use cylinder of diameter 150 mm and height 300 mm).COMPRESSIVE STRENGTH OF CONCRETE CUBESCompressive strength of concrete: Out of many test applied to the concrete,this is the utmost important which gives an idea about all the characteristics of concrete.By this single test one judge that whether Concreting has been done properly or not.

## In situ core strength compared to standard cube …
In situ core strength compared to standard cube strength There is no unique relationship between the strength of in situ concrete,obtained from a core taken from a structure,and that of a standard cured cube cast from the same concrete.Any relationship is aCompressive Strength Of ConcreteThe concrete cube Should be fully vibrated and fully curing.Than we are able to find out the compressive strength of concrete in compression machine.Below List for the compressive strength of concrete.Grade of Concrete Minimum Compressive Strength of concrete N mm2 after 7 days

## What is the reason for attaining same strength of …
Later for 28 days also the strength of the concrete is same.what will be the reason to get.how many samples were used for determination of average compressive strength at respective days of.Compressive Strength of Concrete Cube Test ProcedureThe compressive strength of concrete test is one of the post test widely doing at the site to find out the compression strength of particular concrete batch.Why was the size of mould chosen 150mm x 150mm x 150mm? The standard mould size 150mm x 150mm x 150mm has used for casting the cube because when we increase the size of mould then it will be difficult to handle the cube.

## Models for Prediction of Day Concrete …
The design codes usually specify day concrete compressive strength as design strength for reinforced concrete (RC) structures.Concrete specimens are cast and tested at 28 days to ensure.
