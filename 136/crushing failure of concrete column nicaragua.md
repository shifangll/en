## Types Of Failures In Beam
Flexural failures are two types Brittle flexural failure and Ductile flexure failure.Brittle Flexure Failure The brittle flexural failure is characterized by the crushing of concrete before the rebar yields and it’s very acute because it doesn’t give warning to the residents.Experimental analysis of reinforced concrete columns …The monolithic reference column P2 reached concrete crushing strain.Despite failing to reach concrete crushing values,column P1 showed a curve which followed this tendency.Strains measured on the concrete of columns P3,P4 and P5,all strengthened
