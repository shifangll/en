## Slag
Slag is the glass like by product left over after a desired metal has been separated (i.e.smelted) from its raw ore.Slag is usually a mixture of metal oxides and silicon dioxide.However,slags can contain metal sulfides and elemental metals.While slags are generally used to remove waste in metal smelting,they can also serve other.Influence of slag composition on the, SpringerLinkDec 18,2017&#0183;&#32;Silicomanganese slag was ground using a Pukka ring mill pulverizer to reduce the as received coarse granules to a fine powder The average particle size was 112 &#177; 01 &#181;m and 778 &#177; 04 &#181;m for blast furnace slag and silicomanganese slag,respectively (average values of four measurements),determined by laser diffraction using a dry dispersion unit
