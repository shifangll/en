## Evaluation of the Effect of Fly Ash and Slag on the …
The application of cement asphalt mortar (CAM) in modern high speed railways has been gaining attention due to its combined merits between asphalt and cement hydration product characteristics.To promote sustainable development,it is promising to utilize by products in the making of new CAM instead of using only cement.In this research,the cement content was partly replaced by fly ash or.Effect of Water Granulation Conditions on Density and,21 Method of Investigating Quality of Water Granulated Slag To investigate the relationship between the density and grain size of water granulated slag and the molten slag temperature,blowing water temperature,slag flow rate,and water slag ratio,water granulated slag samples were taken from an actual water granulation system during the tapping period

## WO2008145189A1 Process for preparing a filler for,
The present invention relates to a process for preparing,starting from a slag material,a filler for construction materials which contain bitumen or a hydraulic binding agent The slag used to prepare the filler contains y dicalcium silicate The process comprises the step of removing from the slag material a finer fraction formed by particles of a size between 0 and at least 075 mm so as.SlagThe water carries the slag in its slurry format to a large agitation tank,from where it is pumped along a piping system into a number of gravel based filter beds.The filter beds then retain the slag granules,while the water drains away and is returned to the system.

## Introduction of slag cement Cement Science
Ground granulated blast furnace slag (GGBFS),which normally contains up to 95% of glass,is formed by cooling the liquid slag with large amount of water and subsequently ground to fine powder If the liquid slag is partially cooled with water and then flung to air,pelletized slag could be thus producedCommon Uses for Slag National Slag AssociationMolten slag is generally placed into ground bays for cooling Both BOF and EAF slags are somewhat heavier than Blast Furnace Slag and most quarried rock material Uses include Blending with many other products such as granulated slag,fly ash and lime to form pavement material,skid resistant asphalt aggregate and unconfined construction fill
