## The Extraction of Copper
Extracting copper from its ores The method used to extract copper from its ores depends on the nature of the ore.Sulfide ores such as chalcopyrite (\(CuFeS 2\)) are converted to copper by a different method from silicate,carbonate or sulfate ores.Chalcopyrite.How copper is extracted by phytomining and bioleaching(sometimes copper can be found in low grade ores) but phytomining is used rarely to produce zinc and lead is because they are more reactive than gold nickel and copper.this is why phytomining.

## What is Bioleaching? (with pictures)
&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;Bioleaching is the use of bacterial microorganisms to extract precious metals,such as gold,from ore in which it is embedded.As an alternative to smelting or roasting,miners use bioleaching when there are lower concentrations of metal in ore and they need an efficient,environmentally responsible method to extract it.BioleachingBioleaching is the extraction of metals from their ores through the use of living organisms.This is much cleaner than the traditional heap leaching using cyanide.[1] Bioleaching is one of several applications within biohydrometallurgy and several methods are used to recover copper,zinc,lead,arsenic,antimony,nickel,molybdenum,gold,silver,and cobalt
