## Furnace Sorbent Injection
Bruce G.Miller,in Clean Coal Engineering Technology (Second Edition),2017Furnace sorbent injection With the exception of LIMB,furnace sorbent injection (FSI) is the simplest dry sorbent process.In this process,illustrated in Fig.9.6A,pulverized sorbents,most often calcium hydroxide and sometimes limestone,are injected into the upper part of the furnace to react with the SO 2 in the.Quality of Agricultural Limestone Plant and Soil Sciences eLibraryWater content — does not directly influence ECC but it does influence the amount of material to apply.Purity is Calcium carbonate (CaCO3) is not very soluble in water.One acre Water content must be considered when using byproduct or refuse liming materials and ag lime produced from "soft or porous" limestone.
