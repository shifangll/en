## Coal preparation plant
A coal preparation plant (CPP; also known as a coal handling and preparation plant (CHPP),coal handling plant,prep plant,tipple or wash plant) is a facility that washes coal of soil and rock,crushes it into graded sized chunks (sorting),stockpiles grades preparing it for transport to market,and more often than not,also loads coal into rail cars,barges,or ships.Coal Beneficiation Process DiagramModern Coal Preparation Advantages Flotation,with the “Sub A” gravity flow principle,provides the ideal way to treat coal fines even as coarse as —3 16” top size.According to reports from plants operating for the production of metallurgi cal coke,each percent ash.

## Coal mining
Most coal seams are too deep underground for opencast mining and require underground mining,a method that currently accounts for about 60 percent of world coal production.[6] In deep mining,the room and pillar or bord and pillar method progresses along the seam,while pillars and timber are left standing to support the mine roof.ISO 8833:1989(en),Magnetite for use in coal preparation ? …The basic requirements for a material to be used in dense medium suspension are that it should be inert,have a high relative density and be easy to recover.In coal preparation,the mineral magnetite (FeO,Fe 2 O 3) has become the most commonly used material,not only because it fulfils all the above criteria,but also because of its worldwide occurrence either as an iron ore or as a by.
