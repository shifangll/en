## Mining
Mining is the extraction of valuable minerals or other geological materials from the Earth,usually from an ore body,lode,vein,seam,reef or placer deposit.These deposits form a mineralized package that is of economic interest to the miner.Ores recovered by mining include metals,coal,oil shale,gemstones,limestone,chalk,dimension.CUT AND FILL MININGCut and fill mining can be used with steeply dipping as well as mildly dipping orebodies with reasonably firm ore.Small as well as large deposits with irregular outline can be worked.It is thus a versatile method.The filling operations ae easier with steeper deposits.

## Copper Production: How Is Copper Made?
Copper processing is a complex process that involves many steps as the manufacturer processes the ore from its raw,mined state into a purified form for use in many industries.Copper is typically extracted from oxide and sulfide ores that contain between 0.5 and 2.0% copper.Innovations: Introduction to Copper: Mining &amp; ExtractionCopper processing is a complicated process that begins with mining of the ore (less than 1% copper) and ends with sheets of 99.99% pure copper called cathodes,which will ultimately be made into products for everyday use.The most common types of ore,copper oxide and copper sulfide,undergo two different processes,hydrometallurgy and pyrometallurgy,respectively,due to the different.
