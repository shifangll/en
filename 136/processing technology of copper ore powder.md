## Copper processing
Extraction and refining The extraction of copper from ore is normally carried out in three major steps.The first step,mineral processing,is to liberate the copper minerals and remove waste constituents—such as alumina,limestone,pyrite,and silica—so that the copper minerals and other nonferrous minerals of value are concentrated into a product containing between 20 and 30 percent copper.Copper Handbookonly 0.0058% copper.Economically relevant iron ore deposits contair 65% iron,and bauxite deposits 29% aluminum.In contrast,economically rele vant copper deposits contain only 0.6% copper.What all this means is that the copper in a co,per
