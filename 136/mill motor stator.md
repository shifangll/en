## Stepper motor
Stepper motor performance is strongly dependent on the driver circuit.Torque curves may be extended to greater speeds if the stator poles can be reversed more quickly,the limiting factor being a combination of the winding inductance.To overcome the inductance and switch the windings quickly,one mustSynchronous motorA synchronous electric motor is an AC motor in which,at steady state,[1] the rotation of the shaft is synchronized with the frequency of the supply current; the rotation period is exactly equal to an integral number of AC cycles.Synchronous motors contain multiphase AC electromagnets on the stator of the motor that create a magnetic field.

## Gearless mill drives
Our GMD eliminates all mechanical components of a conventional mill drive system,such as ring gear,pinion,gearbox,coupling,motor shaft and motor bearings: By mounting the rotor poles directly onto the mill,the mill itself becomes the rotor of the gearless motor.Rotor Stator Homogenizers Glen MillsRotor Stator Homogenizers.This type of homogenizer employs a high speed,tightly fitted rotor inside a many toothed stator.The samples to be homogenized are drawn into the center of the rotor having been mixed,accelerated and pressed through the narrow gap between the rotor and stator.
