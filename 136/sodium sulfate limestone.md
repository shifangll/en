## Acid and Sulphate Resistance of Limestone Blended …
The testing program includes abrasion,sulphate,and acid resistance.The test results were compared to the theoretical hypotheses.Durability of pervious concrete exposed to sulphate and acid has been studied on specimen fully submerged in 5% sodiumsodium sulfate and lime doesn't react?&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;When adding a diluted lime (albeit saturated) solution to the given solution of sodium sulfate,one dilutes even more the sulfate and the hydroxide.As long as the products of the ionic concentrations do not reach the solubility products one cannot get a precipitate.

## Magnesium sulfate
Magnesium sulfate is an inorganic salt with the formula MgSO4(H2O)x where 0≤x≤7.It is often encountered as the heptahydrate sulfate mineral epsomite (MgSO4&#183;7H2O),commonly called Epsom salt.The overall global annual usage in the mid s of the monohydrate was 2.3 million tons,of which the majority was used in agriculture.[1] Epsom.Magnesium carbonateIf magnesium chloride (or sulfate) is treated with aqueous sodium carbonate,a precipitate of basic magnesium carbonate—a hydrated complex of magnesium carbonate and magnesium hydroxide—rather than magnesium carbonate itself is formed: 5MgCl 2 2 CO
