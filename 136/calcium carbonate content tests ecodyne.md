## Standard Test Method for Rapid Determination of Carbonate,
D4373 14 Standard Test Method for Rapid Determination of Carbonate Content of Soils carbonate content~ gasometric method~ calcareous soils~ marine soils~,(such as Method C25 and Test Method D3042) to evaluate calcium carbonate equivalency for purposes of characterizing use of calcareous materials as soil modifiers or agricultural lining.Calcium BicarbonateCalcium bicarbonate solution produced under high pressure can spontaneously form calcium carbonate under atmospheric pressure.The problem of bicarbonate biocement produced by the treatment of CaCO 3 or Ca(OH) 2 is its low concentration and instability,so the solution must be produced and stored at elevated partial pressure of CO 2.
