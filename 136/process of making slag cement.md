## Modification of Basic Oxygen Furnace Slag for Cement,
Jun 19,2017&#0183;&#32;The use of steelmaking slag without chemical modification presents a deleterious effect on cement mechanical properties,due to the expansion caused by the presence of free CaO and MgO in the slag This work deals with the modification of one basic oxygen furnace (BOF) slag with the objective of making it an appropriate additive in blended cement formulations Two different modified slags,125 Iron And Steel Production02 to 04 tons of slag,and 25 to 35 tons of blast furnace gas containing up to 100 pounds (lb) of dust The molten iron and slag are removed,or cast,from the furnace periodically The casting process begins with drilling a hole,called the taphole,into the clay filled iron notch at the base of the hearth
