## The Density of Common Rocks and Minerals
The densities of rocks and minerals are normally expressed as specific gravity,which is the density of the rock relative to the density of water.This isn't as complex as you may think because water's density is 1 gram per cubic centimeter or 1 g cm 3.Therefore.Aggregate Base Density Data&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;You need to talk to someone with experience in doing this calculation.For example,the weight of poured in place concrete,with reinforcement,is only 150 lb ft^3.There is no way that compacted base weighs more than that.You're going way off on a tangent
