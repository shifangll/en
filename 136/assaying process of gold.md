## Metallurgical assay
A metallurgical assay is a compositional analysis of an ore,metal,or alloy.Some assay methods are suitable for raw materials; others are more appropriate for finished goods.Raw precious metals are assayed by an assay office.Silver is assayed by titration,gold by cupellation and platinum by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP OES).Gold: History of Use,Mining,Prospecting,Assay &amp; …A USGS publication on the history of gold uses,gold mining,gold prospecting,assays and gold production.Gold as a Medium of Exchange Nations of the world today use gold as a medium of exchange in monetary transactions.A large part of the gold stocks of.

## The Process of Assaying
Fire assaying is most often used to determine the percentages of silver or gold in a rock ore by weight.The first step of the fire assaying process is to prepare the samples.Unprocessed ore rocks need to be crushed into what is called a “pulp” essentially a fine.Processing,smelting and refining gold World Gold CouncilThe Miller process uses gaseous chlorine to extract impurities when gold is at melting point; impurities separate into a layer on the surface of the molten purified gold.The Miller process is rapid and simple,but it produces gold of only about 99.5 percent purity.
