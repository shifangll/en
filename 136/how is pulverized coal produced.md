## Electricity in the U.S.
Hydropower plants produced about 7% of total U.S.electricity generation and about 38% of electricity generation from renewable energy in 2019.Hydropower plants use flowing water to spin a turbine connected to a generator.Wind energy was the source of about 7% of total U.S.electricity generation and about 42% of electricity generation from renewable energy in 2019.Metallurgical coalMetallurgical coal is low in ash,moisture,sulfur and phosphorus content,and its rank is usually bituminous.Some grades of anthracite coal are used for sintering,pulverized coal injection,direct blast furnace charge,pelletizing,and in production of ferro alloys.
