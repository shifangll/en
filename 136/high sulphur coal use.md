## A novel and effective method for removing organic sulfur,
The total sulfur content of low rank coal was about 214% while the organic sulfur content was about 185%,which indicates the sulfur in the used low rank coal is primarily from organic sulfur Low rank coal was heated in the furnace under the nitrogen atmosphere for 1 hCommentary: South Korea's sulphur cap alters Asian coal …Such a low sulphur limit effectively knocks out much of the thermal coal from Australia,which generally produces coal with a high energy value,but also higher sulphur content than rivals such as.
