## Cement Manufacturing Process
Stage of Cement Manufacture There are six main stages of cement manufacturing process.Stage 1 Raw Material Extraction Quarry The raw cement ingredients needed for cement production are limestone (calcium),sand and clay (silicon,aluminum,iron),shale,fly ash,mill scale and bauxite.Cement: Materials and manufacturing process• Carboniferous limestones are the major source of raw material in Britain.The other main limestones are Cretaceous (Chalk) and Jurassic.• Chalk is porous and often has high moisture content that leads it to its use in the ‘semi dry wet’ manufacturing process of making cement.
