## Ammonium sulfate (NH4)2SO4 PubChem
Ammonium sulfate is an inorganic sulfate salt obtained by reaction of sulfuric acid with two equivalents of ammonia.A high melting (decomposes above 280℃) white solid which is very soluble in water (70.6 g 100 g water at 0℃; 103.8 g 100 g water at 100℃),it is widely used as a fertilizer for alkaline soils.It has a role as a fertilizer.Production process of ammonium sulphate and …Ammonium sulphate and by product crude calcium carbonate were prepared by double decomposition reaction with natural gypsum and ammonium bicarbonate as raw materials.Influences of the factors,such as reaction temperature,reaction time,mix ratio,and liquid solid ratio,on conversion rate of calcium sulphate were discussed,and the optimum technological conditions of double decomposition reaction.
