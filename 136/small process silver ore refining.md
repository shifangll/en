## How to Refine Silver sapling
When refining silver you want to make sure you do this outside where there is plenty of ventilation.Give yourself plenty of room in order to have a quicker dissolving reaction from the silver.Depending on how much silver you have to refine will depend on how many 5How To Use Nitric Acid To Purify SilverHere is the recipe method if you want to use Nitric Acid To Purify Silver: First; The Dangers of Nitric Acid Place the silver in a beaker or Pyrex container.Add 3 parts distilled water to 1 part nitric acid.Place on stove or hot plate and simmer until all of the metals are.

The electrolytic silver refining process is similar to gold,except that the silver anodes are dissolved in a bath of nitric acid.The resulting cathodes are 99.9% pure silver.As with small gold bar production,these cathodes are melted,granulated and cast into retail sized bars (most common being 100oz or kilo).The Gold Smelting ProcessGold miners have to smelt their gold in order to remove impurities resulting in pure gold.Most large scale gold miners send their ore to smelters with large equipment for the smelting process.Small scale miners still can do their own smelting using specialized kilns.
