## Foam concrete
Foam concrete,also known as Lightweight Cellular Concrete (LCC),Low Density Cellular Concrete (LDCC),and other terms is defined as a cement based slurry,with a minimum of 20% (per volume) foam entrained into the plastic mortar.[1] As mostly no coarse aggregate is used for production of foam concrete the correct term would be called mortar.Lightweight concreteConcrete is considered to be lightweight is the density is not more than 2200kg m 3 (the density of normal weight concrete is assumed to be between 2300kg m kg m 3) and a proportion of the aggregate should have a density of less than 2000kg m 3

## Concrete
Concrete is strong in compression,as the aggregate efficiently carries the compression load.However,it is weak in tension as the cement holding the aggregate in place can crack,allowing the structure to fail.Reinforced concrete adds either steel reinforcing bars,steel fibers,aramid fibers,carbon fibers,glass fibers,or plastic fibers to carry tensile loads.what is the unit weight of concrete in KN m3?
