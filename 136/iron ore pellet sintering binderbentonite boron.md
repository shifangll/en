## Pelletization
&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;Similar to sintering,pelletizing is another widely used process to agglomerate the iron ore.Sinter plants are usually located near the blast furnace plant,but pelletizing plants are often located near the mining site.Some works have both pelletizing and sinteringbentonite addition in iron sinter plantsVariation in physico chemical properties of iron oxide pellets using.Bentonite and calcium hydroxide are the widely used binding materials in iron ore pelletizing plants.1000 1200 oC,was probably due to the sintering of fine hematite particles.addition may be explained as follows: Bentonite has a layer.
