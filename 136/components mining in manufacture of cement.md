## Composition of cement Penn State Engineering
This is a complex process that is best understood by first understanding the chemical composition of cement Manufacture of cement Portland cement is manufactured by crushing,milling and proportioning the following materials: Lime or calcium oxide,CaO: from limestone,chalk,shells,shale or calcareous rock.Cement clinkerCement clinker is a solid material produced in the manufacture of Portland cement as an intermediary product.Clinker occurs as lumps or nodules,usually 3 millimetres (0.12 in) to 25 millimetres (0.98 in) in diameter.It is produced by sintering (fusing together without melting to the point of liquefaction) limestone and aluminosilicate materials such as clay during the cement kiln stage.
