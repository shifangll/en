Aggregate may be natural,manufactured or recycled.It includes gravel,crushed stone,sand,slag,recycled concrete and geosynthetic aggregates.For a good concrete mix,aggregates need to be clean,hard,strong particles free of absorbed chemicals or coatings.What happened when we not used 20 mm size aggregate …Your question is not clear.Do you want to use concrete with nominal maximum size of aggregate less than 20 mm (i.e.10 mm,12.5 mm or 6.3 mm) or you wish to have concrete with say NMSA 40 mm and jumping to 10 mm while grading.Scenario 1: This is.
