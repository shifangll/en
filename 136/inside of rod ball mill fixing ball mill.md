The ball mill is a tumbling mill that uses steel balls as the grinding media.The length of the cylindrical shell is usually 1 1.5 times the shell diameter (Figure 8.11).The feed can be dry,with less than 3% moisture to minimize ball coating,or slurry containing 20 40% water by weight.Ball and Rod MillRod mills are grinding machine which employ high carbon steel or special steel rods of nearly the same length as that of the drum,in place of steel balls in ball mills.Rod mill products are generally coarser than those produced in a ball mill,and rod mills are well suited to handle coarser feed and to control the top size of the product.

Rod Mills may be considered either fine crushers or coarse grinding equipment.They are capable of taking as large as 2″ feed and making a product as fine as 48 mesh.Of particular advantage is their adaptability to handling wet sticky ores,which normally would.Ball Mills vs Rod MillsThe average particle is subjected to an action similar to many sets of rolls in series,before it is discharged.Because of this,the rod mill can effectively reduce 1″ feed size to 10 mesh or finer in open circuit.The voids (or interstitial space) within a rod load are approximately half those in a ball mill …
