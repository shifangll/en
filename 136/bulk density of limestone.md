## Limestone volume to weight conversion
About Limestone 1 cubic meter of Limestone weighs 2 711 kilograms [kg] 1 cubic foot of Limestone weighs 169.2422 pounds [lbs] Limestone weighs 2.711 gram per cubic centimeter or 2 711 kilogram per cubic meter,i.e.density of limestone is equal to 2 711 kg m&#179;; at 25.2 C (77.36 F or 298.35K) at standard atmospheric pressure.Density logging PetroWikiAt this high energy level,Compton scattering dominat The average electron density in the volume of formation probed by the tool controls the scattered gamma ray count rates at the detectors As we saw above,average electron density,in turn,correlates strongly (but not perfectly) with bulk density

## Density logging
Density logging is a well logging tool that can provide a continuous record of a formation's bulk density along the length of a borehole.In geology,bulk density is a function of the density of the minerals forming a rock (i.e.matrix) and the fluid enclosed in the pore spaces.This is one of three well logging tools that are commonly used to.What is the bulk density of limestone AnswersThe density of limestone is very variable as it is a natural earth material As such,a range of densities are quoted in the literature and testing should be done on a specific sample to get an.

## Neutron Density QuickLook method 201711 Dak
Neutron porosity is referenced to limestone Density porosity is referenced to limestone (RHOma = 271 g cm3),OR Bulk Density is scaled to be equivalent to density and limestone neutron porosity (NOTE the scales in the pages above,for both limestone‐ and sandstone‐referenced curves)Bulk density limestone stockpile Earthwork grading,since we don't know the specific gravity of your limestone and we don't know if it is crushed or screened or just rough blasted material from a pit,then we really have no idea what either the unit weight or the void ratio is so bulk density and volume of a stockpile could vary immensely
