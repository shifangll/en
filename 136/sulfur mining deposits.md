The Rabbit Hole Sulphur Mines are located in northwestern Humboldt County,Nevada,on the border of the Black Rock desert.The deposit was located in 1875 and mining continued until the 1950’s.Early History As early as 1869,efforts were made to exploit sulfur.SULPHUR MINING DEPOSITS MININGMining sulfur by this method was to precipitate sulfur that is covered by a very thick layer of soil.Mining in this way with the injection of hot water (+ 160 &#176; C) into the pipe to be used.This hot water is used to dissolve the salt dome sulfur from sediment or the like at depths between 170 m.
