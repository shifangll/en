## How to Make Lightweight Concrete Hunker
Lightweight concrete may not be as structurally sound as traditional concrete,but it can be useful in some projects where weight is more important than strength.To make this concrete,combine 8 parts cement,sand and lightweight aggregate with 5 parts water.ShotcreteShotcrete,gunite ˈɡʌnaɪt or sprayed concrete is concrete or mortar conveyed through a hose and pneumatically projected at high velocity onto a surface,as a construction technique,first used in 1914.[1]:7 It is typically reinforced by conventional steel rods,steel mesh,or fibers.Shotcrete is usually an all inclusive term for both.
