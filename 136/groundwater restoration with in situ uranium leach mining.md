## Restoration of Uranium InSitu Leaching Sites OnePetro
In recent years insitu leach mining has emerged as a new technology for the recovery of uranium from strata that cannot be mined economically by other means.Because the ore bodies lie within groundwater aquifers,a significant determinant in the process' viability is the requirement that such aquifers be protected from contamination.uranium leachingUranium is currently mined via open pit and underground mining as well as with in situ leaching methods,with in situ leaching currently accounting for approximately 45 % of total uranium production.Studies have shown that the presence of uranium in soils strongly affects the composition and function of resident microbial communities.

## Environmental hydrogeology of in situ leach uranium mining
Abstract.The use of the 'in situ leach' technique of uranium mining is a new development in Australia's expanding uranium industry.To date there have been three sites of pilot leach mines at Beverley (1998) and Honeymoon (1982,19982000) in South Australia and at Manyingee (1985) in Western Australia.In situ leachiv Groundwater Restoration Following In Situ Leach Mining of Uranium by Omar A.Ruiz Lopez Bachelor of Science in Civil Engineering Master of Science in Civil Engineering Abstract From 1950 to the early 1980’s New Mexico played an important role in the

## Uranium: How is it Mined? New Mexico Institute of Mining
Uranium resources can be extracted from the ground in three ways: open pit,underground,and insitu leach (ISL).Open Pit Mining.Open pit mining,also known as strip mining,is the removal of surficial soils and uneconomic rock to get at the ore below.Ore grades are normally less than 0.5%.Impacts of Uranium In Situ LeachingGroundwater restoration at uranium in situ recovery mines,south Texas coastal plain,by Susan Hall,U.S.Geological Survey Open File Report 2009 1143,2009,32 p.Consideration of Geochemical Issues in Groundwater Restoration at Uranium In Situ Leach

## Aquifer Restoration Techniques for In Situ Leach Uranium Mines
regulatory agencies require that an active restoration technique be used at in situ leach sites.The natural system itself will have some capability for re establishing pre mining chemical conditions in the ore zone and for retard ing theIn situ leach — Wikipedia Republished WIKI 22019612&ensp&#0183&enspInsitu leaching (ISL),also called insitu recovery (ISR) or solution mining,is a mining process used to recover minerals such as copper and uranium through boreholes drilled into a deposit,in situ.In situ leach works by artificially dissolving minerals occurring naturally in a solid state.For recovery of material occurring naturally in solution,see: Brine mining.
