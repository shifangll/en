Concrete is strong in compression,as the aggregate efficiently carries the compression load.However,it is weak in tension as the cement holding the aggregate in place can crack,allowing the structure to fail.Reinforced concrete adds either steel reinforcing bars,steel fibers,aramid fibers,carbon fibers,glass fibers,or plastic fibers to carry tensile loads.Concrete CalculatorCalculate concrete volume and cost of concrete slabs,footers,walls,columns,steps,curbs and gutters in cubic feet,cubic yards and cubic meters Calculate for quantity of items to fill for a total project need of cement in cubic feet and cubic yards Yardage of concrete
