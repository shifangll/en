## Modeling of power consumption of ball mill
The possibility of predicting energy consumption for ball mill concentrator when implementing intelligent forecasting system.Compiled modelWhat is the consumption of electricity in 1 2 H.P.motor in …Energy Consumed is expressed in kiloWatt hour (kWh) or what we commonly call as unit Energy = Power x Time (for getting Energy in “kiloWatt hour or unit”,make Power in kilo Watts and Time in Hours).So Here,* Power = 1 2 H.P or 373 Watts or 0.37.
