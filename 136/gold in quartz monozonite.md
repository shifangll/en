## Cripple Creek &amp; Victor Gold Mine
The Cripple Creek &amp; Victor Gold Mine,formerly and historically the Cresson Mine,is an active gold mine located near the town of Victor,in the Cripple Creek mining district in the US state of Colorado.The richest gold mine in Colorado history,[1] it is the only remaining significant producer of gold in the state,and produced 322,000 troy.Where are Gold Deposits in CanadaPlacer deposits of gold are formed by the concentration of the gold from the debris of gold veins and other deposits of gold in rock.As the loose material is washed down hillsides into gullies and valleys,the gold,being six or seven times as heavy as quartz and other rock minerals,quickly works its way to the bottom of the moving mass and stays there.
