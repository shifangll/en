In their study,ceramic tile waste was used in the concrete as a replacement for natural coarse aggregate with (0%,10%,20%,and 30%) of the substitution and M20 grade concrete were used The concrete moulds were cast and tested for compressive strength and split tensile strength after a curing period of 3,7 and 28 daysExperimental Analysis on Concrete by Partial,The quantity of cement,fine and coarse aggregates,ceramic tile wastes,water and Super plasticiser for each batch of proportions were prepared Here M30 concrete mix is designed as per IS 10262 2009 code,From the figure 5 given below,the compressive strength of concrete made using 10% replacement level reduced when compared
